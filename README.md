# exegesis
A handbook for computational theology.

## Overview

Study of any material, especially that which we consider _sacred_ must begin with uncovering the author's intent.
Any other premise is not only faulty but useless- if any reader or hearer can truly infer _their own_ meaning then communication is pointless.
Suffice to say that getting at the author's intent may be simple but not easy.
It may be straightforward but arduous.

Exegesis is the art of uncovering this truth that the author laid down.
Computation is the means by which we accelerate this discovery.

This requires multiple levels of analysis:
- contextual
- historical
- cultural
- linguistic
- literary
- theological

The meaning of a text cannot contradict any of these analyses but must yield to all of them;
and it must consistent throughout the entire narrative.
Any other interpretation is invalid.

So, our aim is to create a valid foundation upon which we build interpretations that are true and meaningful to our audience.
We do this by looking at all facets of the gem which is holy scripture.
