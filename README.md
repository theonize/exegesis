# exegesis
A handbook for computational exegetics.

## Overview

Study of any material, especially that which we consider _sacred_ must begin with uncovering the author's intent.
Any other premise is not only faulty but useless- if any reader or hearer can infer any meaning then communication it pointless.
Suffice to say that getting at the author's intent may be simple but not easy.
It may be straightforward but arduous.

Exegesis is the art of uncovering this truth that the author laid down.
Computation is the means by which we accelerate this spelunking.
