# Exegetical Analysis of Genesis 2:4-17 - Man Placed in Eden

## The Passage

> **4** These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
>
> **5** When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground, **6** and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground— **7** then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
>
> **8** And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed. **9** And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
>
> **10** A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers. **11** The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold. **12** And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there. **13** The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush. **14** The name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
>
> **15** The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. **16** And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden, **17** but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."

## Historical & Cultural Analysis

### Authorship

**Traditional View: Mosaic Authorship**

Traditionally, Genesis has been attributed to Moses, who is credited as the author of the entire Pentateuch (Torah). This view was unquestioned by both Jews and Christians until the European Enlightenment. According to traditional scholarship, the date of composition would fall between c. 1446 BC (the Exodus) and c. 1406 BC (Moses' death).

Evidence supporting Mosaic authorship includes:
- Moses was raised in Pharaoh's courts (Exodus 2:10; Acts 7:20-22) and had access to Egyptian royal education, giving him knowledge of ancient Near Eastern literary traditions
- The rest of the Old Testament consistently connects Moses to the Torah (Joshua 1:7, 8:31; 1 Kings 2:3; 2 Chronicles 23:18; Ezra 3:2; Nehemiah 8:1; Daniel 9:11; Malachi 4:4)
- Linguistic features: early Hebrew lack of distinction between "he" and "she" found only in the Pentateuch supports an ancient date
- Egyptian loanwords in Biblical Hebrew appear prominently in the Pentateuch

**Critical View: The Documentary Hypothesis (JEDP)**

According to the Documentary Hypothesis, Genesis 2:4-17 is attributed to the **Yahwist (J) source**. The J source is identified by its use of the divine name YHWH (Yahweh) rather than Elohim. The transition at Genesis 2:4 is considered a marker dividing the Priestly account (Genesis 1:1-2:4a) from the Yahwist account (Genesis 2:4b onward).

Characteristics of J:
- Anthropomorphizes God (gives Him human characteristics)
- Originates in the southern Kingdom of Judah
- Focuses on God's promises for salvation
- Uses vivid, earthy narrative style
- God forms man from dust, breathes into his nostrils, walks in the garden

### Original Audience

The original audience was most likely the Israelites during the wilderness wanderings or early settlement period (c. 1446-1400 BC under traditional dating). They were:
- Former slaves newly delivered from Egypt
- Traveling through wilderness toward Canaan
- Needed to understand their identity, their God's nature, and their place in creation
- Surrounded by Egyptian and Canaanite polytheistic cultures with competing origin narratives
- Required foundational teaching about humanity's relationship to God, work, and the created order

### Date and Setting

| View | Date of Composition | Rationale |
|------|---------------------|-----------|
| Traditional (Mosaic) | c. 1446-1406 BC | Moses wrote during wilderness wanderings |
| Classical Documentary (J) | c. 950 BCE | Solomonic-era court literature |
| Current Critical Consensus | c. 5th century BCE | Post-exilic final compilation |

The events described are presented as primordial—occurring at the very beginning of human history.

### Ancient Near Eastern Context

#### Garden-Temple Traditions

Scholars have extensively documented the connection between Eden and ancient Near Eastern temple practices:

**The Garden as Sacred Space:**
- Ancient Near Eastern temples were often associated with gardens
- Kings constructed elaborate royal gardens as symbols of their divine authority and cosmic order
- Gardens represented ordered cosmos over against chaos

**Adam as Priest-King:**
The Hebrew words in Genesis 2:15—**'abad** (to work/serve) and **shamar** (to keep/guard)—are the same word pair used for Levitical priestly duties in the tabernacle (Numbers 3:7-8; 4:23-24). This combination suggests Adam had a priestly function in Eden as God's sanctuary.

#### Parallel Ancient Near Eastern Texts

**Sumerian Paradise of Dilmun:**
- A land where sickness and death were unknown
- Located "at the mouth of the rivers"
- Associated with the gods and immortality

**The Atrahasis Epic (c. 18th century BC):**
- Humans created from clay/earth mixed with divine element
- Humans created to work (though in Atrahasis, to relieve the gods of labor)

**Key Differences from ANE myths:**
- In Genesis, humanity is created peacefully, by divine breath, for relationship with God
- Work is noble vocation, not burden
- One God creates and commands (vs. polytheistic chaos)
- Humanity is dignified, not slave-labor

### Geography of Eden

Genesis 2:10-14 describes four rivers:

| River | Hebrew Name | Identification |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Pishon** | פִּישׁוֹן | Debated; possibly Wadi al-Batin |
| **Gihon** | גִּיחוֹן | Debated; possibly Blue Nile or Karun River |
| **Hiddekel** | חִדֶּקֶל | **Tigris** (clearly identified) |
| **Euphrates** | פְּרָת | **Euphrates** (clearly identified) |

The geography anchors the narrative in recognizable Mesopotamian terrain while including mysterious elements pointing beyond any specific location to a primordial reality now lost.

## Linguistic Analysis

### Original Language

Genesis 2:4-17 is composed in **Classical Biblical Hebrew (CBH)**, characteristic of the Pentateuch. Features include:
- Archaic vocabulary: אֵד (*'ed*, "mist/stream," v.6) is rare
- Waw-consecutive narrative chain (wayyiqtol forms)
- The divine name compound יְהוָה אֱלֹהִים appears 20 times in Genesis 2-3

### Key Hebrew Terms

#### תּוֹלְדוֹת (*toledot*) — "generations/account" (v.4)
- Root: ילד (yld) — "to bear, beget"
- Functions as structural marker throughout Genesis
- Here: "These are the generations of the heavens and the earth"

#### אָדָם (*'adam*) — "man/Adam/humanity"
- Wordplay with אֲדָמָה (*'adamah*, "ground")
- v.7: "YHWH God formed the man (*'adam*), dust from the ground (*'adamah*)"
- Emphasizes humanity's earthy origin and connection to the soil

#### גַּן (*gan*) — "garden"
- Root: גנן (gnn) — "to surround, defend, enclose"
- An enclosed, protected space—distinct from open field (שָׂדֶה)

#### עֵדֶן (*'eden*) — "Eden"
- From Hebrew root עדן: "luxury, delight, pleasure"
- Possibly connected to Akkadian *edinu* (Sumerian EDIN): "plain, steppe"

## Literary Analysis

### Genre

Genesis 2:4-17 belongs to **primeval history** (Gen 1-11) and functions as a **second creation narrative** with distinctive characteristics:
- **Etiological narrative**: Explains origins of humanity, work, relationship to the ground
- **Anthropological focus**: Unlike Genesis 1's cosmic scope, this account centers on humanity
- **Garden narrative**: Sacred space, divine presence, abundance

### Comparison with Genesis 1

## Theological Analysis

### Original Audience Understanding

Ancient Israelites would have drawn these theological truths:

**God as Sovereign Creator:**
- YHWH is the sole Creator—no theogony, no competing gods
- Creation is peaceful, intentional, good

**Humanity's Special Dignity:**
- Formed directly by God's hands (not by word alone)
- Animated by God's personal breath
- Placed in sacred space with meaningful work

**God's Generous Provision:**
- Abundant provision before any command
- "Every tree" freely available
- One prohibition within overwhelming permission

**Contrast with ANE Myths:**
| ANE Myths | Genesis 2 |
|-----------|-----------|
| Gods emerge from chaos | YHWH exists before creation |
| Creation through conflict | YHWH creates peacefully |
| Humans as divine slaves | Humans as dignified stewards |

### Spiritual Disciplines

**Work as Worship (Abad)**
- The Hebrew *'abad* means both "to work" and "to worship"
- Same word describes Levitical priestly service
- All legitimate labor can be service to God

**Stewardship and Guardianship (Shamar)**
- "To guard, watch over, protect"
- Same vocabulary used for keeping commandments
- Eden as proto-temple, Adam as proto-priest

**Obedience to Divine Command**
- God's prohibition was loving protection
- Obedience is the path of life
- Freedom includes limits

**Dependence on God**
- Life comes from God's breath alone
- Provision flows from divine initiative
- The tree of life represents ongoing dependence

### Timeless Principles

1. **Human Dignity**: Made by God's hands, animated by His breath—every human life has intrinsic worth

2. **Vocation**: Work is pre-Fall, good, and purposeful—part of what it means to be human

3. **Freedom with Limits**: Genuine freedom flourishes within appropriate boundaries

4. **Consequence of Rebellion**: Disobedience to God results in death

5. **Provision Precedes Command**: God gave abundantly before requiring anything—grace before law

6. **Priestly Vocation**: Humanity as priests/guardians of sacred space

7. **The Danger of Autonomy**: The tree represents autonomous moral determination apart from God

### Doctrinal Themes

**Anthropology**: Humanity as material-spiritual unity—formed from dust, animated by divine breath

**Hamartiology**: The passage establishes categories for understanding sin—command, potential disobedience, death-warning

**Covenant Foundations**: The structure of command-blessing-curse establishes the pattern for all biblical covenants

## Hermeneutic

### Canonical Threads and Themes

#### Eden as Temple/Sanctuary

| Eden Feature | Tabernacle/Temple Parallel | Eschatological Fulfillment |
|--------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| God walks in the garden | God's presence in Holy of Holies | God dwelling with humanity (Rev 21:3) |
| Entrance from the east | Tabernacle entrance faced east | New Jerusalem gates (Rev 21:13) |
| Cherubim guard access | Cherubim on the Ark | Cherubim around throne (Rev 4:6-8) |
| Gold and precious stones | Temple adornment | Streets of gold (Rev 21:18-21) |
| River from sacred space | Temple river (Ezek 47) | River of life (Rev 22:1-2) |
| Tree of life | Menorah as stylized tree | Tree of life restored (Rev 22:2) |
| Adam to "work and keep" | Levitical service | Royal priesthood (Rev 22:3-5) |

#### The Temple Trajectory

```
EDEN (Gen 2)           → God dwells with humanity in garden-sanctuary
  ↓
TABERNACLE             → Mobile sanctuary: "I will dwell among them"
  ↓
TEMPLE                 → Permanent sanctuary
  ↓
CHRIST                 → "The Word tabernacled among us" (John 1:14)
  ↓
CHURCH                 → "You are God's temple" (1 Cor 3:16)
  ↓
NEW JERUSALEM          → "The dwelling place of God is with man" (Rev 21:3)
```

#### Tree of Life Trajectory

| Scripture | Context | Significance |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| Genesis 2:9 | Tree in midst of garden | Original access to unending life |
| Genesis 3:22-24 | Access barred by cherubim | Fall blocks the way to life |
| Proverbs 3:18 | Wisdom is "tree of life" | True wisdom gives life |
| Revelation 2:7 | "Tree of life in paradise of God" | Access restored to overcomers |
| Revelation 22:2 | Tree of life for healing of nations | Full restoration in new creation |

#### Second Adam Typology

| First Adam (Genesis 2) | Second Adam (Christ) |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| Formed from dust | Born of woman, took on flesh |
| Placed in a garden | Prayed in Gethsemane; rose from garden tomb |
| Given a command to obey | "I do as the Father commanded" (John 14:31) |
| Failed the test at the tree | Succeeded through the tree (cross) |
| Brought death to all | Brings life to all who believe |

**Romans 5:19**: "For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous."

### Wordplay and Idioms

**Adam/Adamah**: The earthling (*'adam*) from the earth (*'adamah*)—emphasizing creaturely dependence and humility

**Eden as Delight**: The garden was designed for joy, not merely survival

**"Good and Evil" as Merism**: Polar opposites indicating totality—comprehensive moral knowledge, autonomous determination

**"Surely Die" (mot tamut)**: Emphatic Hebrew construction conveying certainty and gravity

### Covenant Structure

Genesis 2:15-17 contains essential covenant elements:

| Covenant Element | Genesis 2 Expression |
|------------------|---------------------|
| Sovereign Initiator | "The LORD God" |
| Covenant Partner | Adam (humanity's representative) |
| Historical Prologue | Creation, placement in garden |
| Stipulation | "You shall not eat" |
| Blessing (Implicit) | Continued life, fellowship |
| Curse/Sanction | "You shall surely die" |

### Plenary Authorship Intent

Through this passage, God intends to communicate:

1. **The Pattern of Human Existence**: Dignified creatures, called to meaningful work, living under God's authority, provided for by His generosity

2. **Foundation for Understanding Sin and Redemption**: Without Genesis 2, we cannot understand why disobedience matters, why death exists, or why we need a Savior

3. **The Hope of Paradise Restored**: Eden features point forward to new creation fulfillment—what was lost will be restored and enhanced

4. **Christ as True Adam**: The One who obeyed where Adam failed, bringing life where Adam brought death

| We are placed for purpose | "Our circumstances are random" | God deliberately places us for His purposes |
| Freedom is bounded | "True freedom has no limits" | God's boundaries are loving protection |
| Life comes from God | "We are self-sufficient" | Every breath is sustained by God |
| Disobedience leads to death | "Sin has no real consequences" | The emphatic Hebrew *mot tamut* is loving warning |

### What Must Change

| Area | Worldly View | Redeemed View |
|------|--------------|---------------|
| **Work** | Burden, necessary evil | Sacred calling, worship |
| **Limitations** | Oppressive restrictions | Loving protection |

- Recognize the dignity of every person as God-formed

**In Church Life:**
- Understand worship and work share the same Hebrew root (*'abad*)
- Integrate your "Sunday worship" with your "Monday work"

### Meaning and Method

| Meaning | Method |
|---------|--------|
| Work is worship | Begin each workday with prayer; dedicate your labor to God |
| We are placed for purpose | Bloom where planted; seek God's will in your current situation |
| Boundaries give life | Identify where you resist God's "no" and practice trust |

- **Commissioned** to work and keep—my labor matters to God
- **Bounded** by God's loving wisdom—His "no" protects me
- **Provided for** abundantly—gratitude is my posture
- **Dependent** on the God who sustains my every breath

### Daily Questions

1. Have I acknowledged my dependence on God today?
2. Am I approaching my work as worship?
3. Am I trusting God's boundaries or grasping for the forbidden?
4. Am I practicing gratitude for God's abundant provision?

## Summary

Genesis 2:4-17 establishes the foundational architecture of biblical theology:

1. **God** is both transcendent Creator (Elohim) and intimate covenant Lord (YHWH)

2. **Humanity** is uniquely dignified—formed by God's hands, animated by His breath, commissioned with sacred work

3. **Eden** is the archetypal sanctuary where heaven and earth meet—the pattern for all subsequent temple theology

4. **Work** is blessing, not curse—meaningful vocation established before the Fall

5. **Freedom** flourishes within boundaries—God's generous "yes" with one protective "no"

6. **The Trees** represent the fundamental human choice: life through dependent trust or death through autonomous grasping

7. **Adam** functions as both priest and covenant head—anticipating both Israel's priesthood and Christ's representative work

8. **The Prohibition** establishes the covenantal pattern (stipulation, blessing, curse) that structures all Scripture

9. **The Trajectory** points forward: what was lost in Eden will be restored and surpassed in the New Jerusalem

This passage is not merely ancient history but the foundation for understanding who God is, who we are, what went wrong, and how Christ makes all things new. To read Genesis 2:4-17 is to read the DNA of the entire biblical narrative.
