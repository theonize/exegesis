# Practical Applications: Genesis 2:4-17 (Man Placed in Eden)

> **4** These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens.
>
> **5** When no bush of the field was yet in the land and no small plant of the field had yet sprung up—for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the land, and there was no man to work the ground,
>
> **6** and a mist was going up from the land and was watering the whole face of the ground—
>
> **7** then the LORD God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature.
>
> **8** And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.
>
> **9** And out of the ground the LORD God made to spring up every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food. The tree of life was in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
>
> **10** A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.
>
> **11** The name of the first is the Pishon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.
>
> **12** And the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.
>
> **13** The name of the second river is the Gihon. It is the one that flowed around the whole land of Cush.
>
> **14** And the name of the third river is the Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.
>
> **15** The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it.
>
> **16** And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may surely eat of every tree of the garden,
>
> **17** but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall surely die."
>

## Clarifying the Original Meaning for a Modern Audience

### The Distinctive Emphasis of Genesis 2:4-17

While Genesis 1:26-31 presents humanity's creation from a cosmic, transcendent perspective, Genesis 2:4-17 offers an intimate, personal account. The shift from "God" (*Elohim*) to "LORD God" (*Yahweh Elohim*) signals a move from the majestic Creator to the covenant-keeping, personally involved God.

### Core Truths for Today

#### 1. God Personally, Intimately Created Humanity — We Are Not Accidents

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "The LORD God **formed** the man of dust" (v. 7a) | The Hebrew *yatsar* (to form, fashion) is the word for a potter shaping clay — intimate, artistic, intentional |
| "**Breathed** into his nostrils the breath of life" (v. 7b) | God's own breath animates us — face-to-face intimacy, not distant creation |
| "The LORD God **planted** a garden... and there he **put** the man" (v. 8) | God personally prepared a home and placed humanity there |

**What This Means for You:**
- You are not a cosmic accident or evolutionary byproduct
- Your existence is the result of divine intention and craftsmanship
- The same God who spoke galaxies into existence knelt in the dust to form you
- Your life began with divine breath — God's own life sustains you

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "I'm just a random collection of cells, the product of chance and time."

**Biblical Truth:** "I was intentionally fashioned by a personal God who breathed his own life into me."

---

#### 2. Work Is a Gift and Calling, Not a Curse (Pre-Fall)

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "There was no man **to work** the ground" (v. 5) | Work was part of God's design before sin entered |
| "The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden **to work it and keep it**" (v. 15) | Work is the reason God placed man in Eden |
| Hebrew *'abad* (to work/serve) and *shamar* (to keep/guard) | Same words used for priestly service and worship |

**What This Means for You:**
- Work is not punishment for sin — that's a post-Fall distortion
- Your vocation (whatever it is) participates in God's purposes
- The Hebrew word *'abad* means both "to work" and "to worship" — work IS worship
- *Shamar* (to keep/guard) implies responsibility and stewardship

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "Work is a necessary evil; real life happens on weekends."

**Biblical Truth:** "Work was God's gift before the Fall; my labor is my worship and calling."

---

#### 3. We Are Placed Where God Wants Us for His Purposes

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "The LORD God... **put** him in the garden of Eden" (v. 8) | The Hebrew *sim* means to place deliberately, with purpose |
| "The LORD God **took** the man and **put** him in the garden" (v. 15) | Repeated emphasis — placement is intentional |
| Eden described with rivers, gold, precious stones (vv. 10-14) | God placed man in a specific, real location |

**What This Means for You:**
- Your current location (city, job, family, circumstances) is not random
- God places his people where he wants them to accomplish his purposes
- Even "exile" situations can be divine placements (cf. Jeremiah 29:4-7)
- Bloom where you are planted — God put you there

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "If only I were somewhere else, with different circumstances, I could really serve God."

**Biblical Truth:** "God has placed me here, in this situation, for his purposes. This is my Eden to work and keep."

---

#### 4. Freedom Is Real but Bounded by God's Wisdom

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "You may **surely eat** of **every** tree of the garden" (v. 16) | Emphatic permission — Hebrew infinitive absolute intensifies |
| "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall **not** eat" (v. 17a) | One prohibition amid abundant permission |
| The ratio is overwhelming: thousands of trees freely given, one restricted | God's "no" is specific and minimal; his "yes" is expansive |

**What This Means for You:**
- God's commands are not primarily about restriction but about abundant provision
- True freedom operates within boundaries — unlimited autonomy destroys
- God's "no" protects and enables flourishing; it doesn't diminish life
- The one tree was not deprivation — it was the condition for trusting relationship

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "God's rules are arbitrary restrictions designed to limit my happiness."

**Biblical Truth:** "God's boundaries are expressions of love and wisdom; they protect my flourishing, not limit it."

---

#### 5. Life Comes from God and Is Sustained by Him

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "Breathed into his nostrils **the breath of life**" (v. 7) | Life originates in God's breath, not autonomous self-existence |
| "The man became a **living creature**" (v. 7) | Hebrew *nephesh chayyah* — life is derived, not inherent |
| Trees "good for food" (v. 9) | Physical sustenance comes from God's provision |
| "Tree of life" in the midst (v. 9) | Ongoing life depends on access to God's provision |

**What This Means for You:**
- Every breath you take is sustained by God
- Life is not a possession you own but a gift you receive moment by moment
- Physical needs (food, shelter, provision) ultimately come from God
- Spiritual life requires continual dependence on the Source of life

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "I am self-sufficient; my life is my own to manage and sustain."

**Biblical Truth:** "My life is borrowed breath; I am utterly dependent on God for every heartbeat."

---

#### 6. Disobedience Leads to Death (Spiritual and Physical)

| Textual Evidence | Modern Application |
|------------------|-------------------|
| "For in the day that you eat of it you shall **surely die**" (v. 17b) | Hebrew *mot tamut* — emphatic: "dying you shall die" |
| Death is consequence, not arbitrary punishment | Sin carries inherent destructive consequences |
| Death contrasts with "breath of life" and "tree of life" | Disobedience cuts off the life-connection |

**What This Means for You:**
- God's warnings are not threats but truths about reality
- Sin is not merely rule-breaking but self-destruction
- "Death" includes spiritual separation, relational fracture, and eventual physical death
- The warning is an act of love — a father warning a child about fire

**Modern Lie Corrected:** "I can sin without significant consequences; God is too loving to let anything bad happen."

**Biblical Truth:** "Disobedience to God's design is self-destruction; his warnings are acts of love to protect me."

## What Must Change: Attributes and Actions for Modern Believers

### 1. View of Work: From Burden to Sacred Calling and Worship

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| "TGIF" — work is something to escape | Work is my primary arena for worship |
| Monday is a curse; weekend is life | Every day is an opportunity to serve God |
| Work is punishment for sin | Work was blessed before the Fall |
| "Secular" vs. "sacred" divide | All legitimate work is sacred |
| I work to live | I work because I'm made for meaningful labor |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- Stop complaining about your work as if it were a curse
- Begin each workday with prayer, recognizing it as worship
- Reject the secular/sacred divide — your "secular" job is ministry
- Work with excellence, not just for paycheck but for God's glory
- Thank God for the ability and opportunity to work

---

### 2. View of Limitations: From Oppression to Loving Protection

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| God's "no" limits my freedom | God's "no" protects my flourishing |
| Rules are arbitrary impositions | Boundaries are expressions of wisdom |
| I know better what's good for me | God's knowledge surpasses mine |
| Restriction = oppression | Restriction = love |
| Unlimited autonomy = freedom | Unlimited autonomy = death |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- When you encounter God's "no," ask "What is this protecting me from?"
- Stop resenting biblical commands as arbitrary rules
- Recognize that "freedom" without boundaries destroys
- Trust that God's wisdom exceeds your understanding
- Obey even when you don't fully understand the reason

---

### 3. View of Self: From Self-Made to God-Formed and God-Placed

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| "I made myself who I am" | God formed me with his own hands |
| "I chose my path" | God placed me where I am |
| "My life is my own" | My life is borrowed breath from God |
| Pride in self-sufficiency | Humble gratitude for divine formation |
| Identity from achievements | Identity from being God's creation |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- Replace "self-made" language with gratitude to God
- Acknowledge your dependence on God for life itself
- Recognize your current situation as divine placement, not random chance
- Find identity in being God's creation, not your accomplishments
- Cultivate humility — you are dust animated by divine breath

---

### 4. View of Creation: From Resource Exploitation to Careful Stewardship

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Nature exists for my use | I am placed to "work and keep" creation |
| Exploit for profit | Steward for God's glory |
| Owner mentality | Gardener/keeper mentality |
| Short-term gain | Long-term faithfulness |
| Creation is just "stuff" | Creation is entrusted treasure |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- See yourself as a gardener/keeper (*shamar*), not an owner
- Care for your "garden" (home, workplace, community) as stewardship
- Make decisions that honor creation as God's work
- Reject both exploitation and nature-worship
- Leave places better than you found them

---

### 5. View of God's Commands: From Arbitrary Rules to Life-Giving Wisdom

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Commands are restrictions | Commands are descriptions of how life works |
| God is withholding good things | God is protecting from destructive things |
| Obedience is begrudging duty | Obedience is wise response to reality |
| "I know better" | "God knows best" |
| Law opposes grace | Law is gracious guidance |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- Read God's commands as love letters, not legal documents
- Ask "What life does this command protect?" instead of "Why can't I?"
- Trust God's wisdom when commands seem restrictive
- Obey cheerfully, not resentfully
- See the Bible as a guidebook for flourishing, not a rulebook for restriction

---

### 6. Attitude Toward Contentment: Abundance Is Gift, Not Entitlement

**The Needed Shift:**

| Worldly/Fallen View | Redeemed View (from Gen 2) |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| I deserve what I have | Everything is gift |
| Accumulate more | Steward well what's given |
| Covet what's forbidden | Be grateful for what's provided |
| Entitlement | Gratitude |
| "Never enough" | "More than enough" |

**Practical Changes Required:**
- Practice daily gratitude for provision — food, shelter, breath
- Stop fixating on the "one tree" you don't have
- Count the "every tree" blessings God has freely given
- Replace entitlement language ("I deserve...") with gratitude ("I've been given...")
- Contentment is not settling; it's recognizing abundance

---

## When, Where, and How to Implement These Changes

### In the Workplace: Approach Monday Like Entering Sacred Space

**The Principle:**
Adam was placed in the garden "to work (*'abad*) and keep (*shamar*) it" — the same Hebrew words used for priestly service in the tabernacle. Your workplace is your sanctuary, your labor is your liturgy.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Morning commute/arrival** | Car, bus, walking to office | Pray: "Lord, I enter this workplace as sacred space. I will work and worship here today." |
| **Beginning of workday** | Desk, station, site | Take 60 seconds to dedicate your labor to God. Ask him to be glorified in your work. |
| **During difficult tasks** | Wherever challenges arise | Remember: "This is my garden to tend. This challenge is part of my calling." |
| **In interactions** | With coworkers, clients | Treat each person as an image-bearer; serve them as serving God. |
| **At day's end** | Before leaving | Thank God for the ability to work; commit unfinished tasks to him. |

**Weekly Practice:**
- Sunday evening: Prepare your heart for the "worship" of Monday's work
- Friday: Reflect on how your work honored God this week

---

### In Environmental Decisions: Practice Dominion as Stewardship

**The Principle:**
God placed humanity in Eden to "*shamar*" (guard, keep, preserve) the garden. We are gardener-priests, not consumer-owners.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Daily consumption** | Home, marketplace | Ask: "Am I consuming as a steward or exploiting as an owner?" |
| **Purchasing decisions** | Stores, online | Consider sustainability, ethics, and environmental impact |
| **Waste management** | Kitchen, office | Reduce, reuse, recycle — "keep" your corner of creation |
| **Home and property** | Yard, living space | Maintain and improve; leave better than you found |
| **Recreation outdoors** | Parks, wilderness | Enjoy creation with gratitude; leave no trace |

**Specific Practices:**
- Reduce unnecessary plastic use
- Conserve water and electricity
- Support ethical and sustainable products when possible
- Teach children to be gardener-keepers, not consumer-exploiters
- Avoid wastefulness as a form of "un-keeping" creation

---

### In Moral Choices: Trust God's Boundaries Over Personal Preferences

**The Principle:**
The prohibition of the one tree was not arbitrary — it was the test of trust, the condition for relationship, the protection against death. God's boundaries are always for our good.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Sexual ethics** | Dating, marriage, media | Trust God's design for sexuality; his "no" protects flourishing |
| **Financial decisions** | Business, personal finance | Operate with integrity; reject "forbidden fruit" shortcuts |
| **Speech and honesty** | Conversations, online | Speak truth; avoid the "fruit" of gossip, slander, deception |
| **Relationships** | Friendships, professional | Maintain appropriate boundaries; trust God's design |
| **Temptation moments** | Anywhere temptation strikes | Remember the pattern: "every tree" freely given; trust the Giver |

**In the Moment of Temptation:**
1. Recall: "God has given me 'every tree' — abundant provision"
2. Recognize: "This 'forbidden fruit' will not satisfy; it leads to death"
3. Reject: "I choose to trust God's wisdom over my desire"
4. Replace: "I will enjoy the abundance God HAS given"

---

### In Daily Provision: Receive Food, Shelter, Work as Gifts

**The Principle:**
Eden was a place of abundant provision — trees "pleasant to the sight and good for food," rivers, gold, precious stones. God provided before man even asked.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **At meals** | Dining table | Give thanks before eating; recognize food as divine provision |
| **Entering your home** | Doorway, living room | Thank God for shelter; not everyone has this gift |
| **Receiving income** | Payday, bank account | Acknowledge: "This provision comes from God through my work" |
| **Using possessions** | Throughout the day | Treat possessions as stewardship, not ownership |
| **Morning awakening** | Bedroom | First breath: "Thank you, God, for another day of life" |

**Daily Practice — The "Eden Gratitude" Exercise:**
- **Morning:** Thank God for breath, life, the new day
- **Meals:** Thank God for food (don't rush past grace)
- **Evening:** Review the day's provisions; express gratitude for specific gifts
- **Weekly:** List five "every tree" blessings you often overlook

---

### In Relationships: Remember We're Dust Animated by Divine Breath — Humility

**The Principle:**
We are "dust from the ground" (*'afar min ha'adamah*) — humble origin. Yet we are animated by God's own breath — exalted dignity. This balance produces humility without shame, confidence without arrogance.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **In conflict** | Home, work, church | Remember: "I am dust; I may be wrong" |
| **When praised** | Public recognition | Remember: "My abilities are divine breath, not self-made" |
| **When criticized** | Feedback situations | Receive humbly; dust can learn and grow |
| **Toward the vulnerable** | Encounters with weak, poor | Remember: "They too are dust with divine breath — equal dignity" |
| **In pride** | Success, achievement | Recall: "Apart from God's breath, I return to dust" |

**Relational Posture:**
- Enter conflicts remembering your dusty origin — humility
- Treat others as fellow dust-creatures with divine breath — dignity
- Serve others as the God-breathed image-bearers they are — honor
- Avoid both doormat self-deprecation and arrogant superiority

---

### In Church Life: Understand Worship and Work Share the Same Hebrew Root

**The Principle:**
The Hebrew *'abad* means both "to work" and "to serve/worship." There is no sacred-secular divide. Adam's garden work was his worship; your gathered worship continues in scattered work.

**Practical Implementation:**

| When | Where | How |
|------|-------|-----|
| **Sunday gathering** | Church building | Recognize this as concentrated worship that overflows into the week |
| **Monday work** | Workplace | See this as extended worship, *'abad* continued |
| **Using gifts** | Church and world | Spiritual gifts serve the body; vocational gifts serve the world |
| **Serving others** | Any service opportunity | All service to others is service (*'abad*) to God |
| **Teaching/discipleship** | Church programs | Help others see their work as worship |

**Integration Practice:**
- Sunday: In corporate worship, dedicate your week's work to God
- Monday-Saturday: Remember that you're still worshiping through work
- Regularly: Refuse the compartmentalization of sacred Sunday and secular week
- Always: See yourself as a "priest" in your workplace, your home, your community

---

## Meaning Versus Method: Practical Steps

### MEANING: Work Is Worship
**METHOD: Begin Each Workday with Prayer Dedicating Your Labor**

**The Principle:**
Since *'abad* means both work and worship, every legitimate task can be offered to God as an act of service.

**Practical Method:**

**The "Eden Workplace Liturgy"**

*Before beginning work:*
> "Lord God, you placed Adam in the garden to work and keep it. Today, you have placed me in this [office/site/home/school] to work and keep it. I dedicate this day's labor to you. May my work be my worship. Help me to serve you in every task, to honor you in every interaction, to glorify you in every outcome. This is your garden; I am your gardener. Amen."

*Throughout the day:*
- When beginning a significant task: "Lord, I offer this to you"
- When facing difficulty: "This is part of my calling; help me tend it well"
- When completing work: "I did this for you, Lord"

*At day's end:*
> "Lord, I now rest from my labor as you rested from yours. I commit my unfinished work to you. Thank you for the gift of meaningful work. Amen."

---

### MEANING: We Are Placed for Purpose
**METHOD: Bloom Where Planted; Seek God's Will in Current Situation**

**The Principle:**
God "took" Adam and "put" (*sim*) him in a specific place with specific work. Your current placement — job, city, family situation, church — is not random.

**Practical Method:**

**The "Planted Purpose" Assessment**

Ask these questions about your current situation:

1. **Where has God placed me?**
   - Geographic location (city, neighborhood)
   - Vocational location (job, role, industry)
   - Relational location (family, church, community)
   - Life stage location (student, worker, parent, retiree)

2. **What is my "garden" to tend?**
   - What responsibilities has God entrusted to me here?
   - What needs exist that my gifts/skills can address?
   - Who are the people I'm called to serve in this place?

3. **How can I "work and keep" this place?**
   - How can I make this place flourish through my labor?
   - How can I protect/preserve what is good here?
   - What would it look like to be faithful in this exact situation?

4. **Am I resisting or embracing my placement?**
   - Am I always looking elsewhere instead of serving here?
   - Am I bitter about my circumstances rather than grateful?
   - Am I waiting to serve God "someday" instead of today?

**Practice:** Write a "Placement Purpose Statement" — one paragraph describing how you believe God has placed you where you are and what "garden work" he has given you.

---

### MEANING: Boundaries Give Life
**METHOD: Identify Where You Resist God's "No" and Practice Trust**

**The Principle:**
The one prohibition was not deprivation but protection. God's boundaries are guardrails on the road to flourishing, not prison walls.

**Practical Method:**

**The "Forbidden Tree" Inventory**

1. **Identify your "trees":**
   - Where are you resisting God's clear commands?
   - What biblical boundaries do you view as oppressive rather than protective?
   - Where do you think you know better than God?

2. **Name the lies:**
   - What lie does the serpent whisper about this boundary?
   - "God is withholding something good..."
   - "You won't really die..."
   - "You'll be better off if you..."

3. **Speak the truth:**
   - "God has given me 'every tree' — abundant provision"
   - "This boundary protects me from death/destruction"
   - "God knows what I don't know; I will trust him"

4. **Practice active trust:**
   - Instead of white-knuckling avoidance, practice grateful obedience
   - Thank God for the boundary: "Thank you for protecting me from..."
   - Enjoy the "every tree" abundance instead of fixating on the one tree

**Weekly Practice:**
Each week, identify one area where you're resisting a biblical boundary. Pray specifically:
> "Lord, I confess I've seen your 'no' as restriction rather than protection. I choose to trust your wisdom. Help me enjoy the abundance you've given instead of coveting what you've forbidden."

---

### MEANING: Life Depends on God
**METHOD: Practice Gratitude for Breath, Food, Existence Daily**

**The Principle:**
Adam's life came from God's breath; he had no independent existence. We are not self-sustaining beings but creatures dependent on the Creator every moment.

**Practical Method:**

**The "Breath of Life" Daily Practice**

*Morning — Conscious Breathing:*
- Upon waking, take three slow, deep breaths
- With each breath, acknowledge: "This breath is from God"
- Pray: "Lord, you breathed life into me. This day's every breath comes from you. I am not self-sustaining; I depend on you completely."

*Meals — Gratitude Before Eating:*
- Pause before every meal (not just dinner)
- Don't rush past grace — really think about what you're saying
- Sample prayer: "God, you made the trees 'good for food.' This meal is your provision. Thank you."

*Evening — Life Review:*
- Before sleep, review the day's provisions:
  - "Thank you for sustaining my life today"
  - "Thank you for provision of [specific things]"
  - "I rest now, trusting you to sustain me through the night"

**Weekly Gratitude Practice:**
- Keep a "breath of life" journal
- Each day, record three specific provisions you noticed
- Weekly, review and give thanks for the pattern of God's sustaining care

---

### MEANING: Stewardship Matters
**METHOD: Audit Your Care of What God Has Entrusted**

**The Principle:**
God placed Adam in the garden "to work (*'abad*) and keep (*shamar*) it." Everything you have is entrusted, not owned. You are a gardener-steward, not an owner-consumer.

**Practical Method:**

**The "Eden Stewardship Audit"**

Conduct this audit monthly or quarterly:

**1. Physical Stewardship (Body)**
- Am I caring for the body God gave me?
- Sleep, nutrition, exercise, rest
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" my body well?

**2. Relational Stewardship (Relationships)**
- Am I tending the relationships God has given?
- Family, friends, church community, neighbors
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" these relationships well?

**3. Vocational Stewardship (Work)**
- Am I faithful in the work God has assigned?
- Quality, diligence, integrity, attitude
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" my vocation well?

**4. Financial Stewardship (Resources)**
- Am I managing money as God's steward?
- Giving, saving, spending, debt
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" these resources well?

**5. Environmental Stewardship (Creation)**
- Am I caring for my corner of creation?
- Home, property, consumption patterns
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" creation well?

**6. Spiritual Stewardship (Soul)**
- Am I tending my relationship with God?
- Prayer, Scripture, worship, sabbath
- Grade: Am I "working and keeping" my soul well?

**After the Audit:**
- Identify one area needing attention
- Create one specific action step
- Review progress at next audit

## Summary: Living as "Placed People" in God's World

### The Identity Statement

> "I am not an accident but a divine creation — dust formed by God's hands and animated by God's breath. I have been placed where I am for God's purposes. My work is my worship. God's boundaries are my protection. I am utterly dependent on him for every breath, and I am called to steward everything he has entrusted to me."

### Daily Integration Questions

1. **Morning:** How will I worship God through my work today?
2. **Work:** Am I approaching my tasks as tending God's garden?
3. **Boundaries:** Where am I tempted to think I know better than God?
4. **Gratitude:** What "every tree" blessings have I received today?
5. **Stewardship:** Am I "working and keeping" what God has entrusted?
6. **Evening:** Do I trust God enough to rest?

### The Seven Practices of Genesis 2:4-17

| Practice | Daily Expression |
|----------|-----------------|
| **1. Sacred Work** | Begin each day dedicating your labor as worship |
| **2. Purposeful Placement** | Bloom where planted; serve where placed |
| **3. Trusted Boundaries** | Obey God's "no" as loving protection |
| **4. Breath Gratitude** | Acknowledge dependence with every breath |
| **5. Gift Receiving** | Receive food, shelter, provision as gifts |
| **6. Dust Humility** | Walk humbly, remembering your origin |
| **7. Faithful Stewardship** | Tend all that's entrusted — body, relationships, work, resources |

### Conclusion

Genesis 2:4-17 is not merely ancient history about the first man in a garden long ago. It is the **paradigm for human existence** — showing us who we are (dust with divine breath), where we belong (placed by God for his purposes), what we're called to do (work and keep as worship and stewardship), and how we're to live (in trusting obedience within God's life-giving boundaries).

Every contemporary believer faces the same fundamental realities Adam faced:
- Will I receive my life as gift or grasp for autonomy?
- Will I embrace my placement or resent my circumstances?
- Will I trust God's boundaries or reach for forbidden fruit?
- Will I work as worship or toil as drudgery?
- Will I steward faithfully or exploit selfishly?

The call of Genesis 2:4-17 is to **live as placed people** — humbly receiving our God-breathed existence, faithfully tending our God-assigned gardens, and trustingly obeying within God's life-giving boundaries.

**You are dust — but divinely breathed dust.**
**You are placed — and divinely commissioned.**
**You are bounded — but abundantly provided for.**

Live accordingly.
