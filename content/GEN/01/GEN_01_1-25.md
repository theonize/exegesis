# Exegetical Analysis of Genesis 1:1-25 - Creation of the World

## Historical & Cultural Analysis

### Who was the author?
Traditionally attributed to Moses, the compiler/author of the Pentateuch. Moses would have been uniquely qualified due to his education in Egyptian royal courts and his divine encounters. While source-critical scholars have proposed multiple documentary sources (J, E, P, D), the traditional view maintains Mosaic authorship with possible later minor editorial updates. Moses' dual cultural background—Egyptian education and Hebrew heritage—equipped him to compose this foundational text.

### What was the original audience?
The Israelites during and after the Exodus from Egypt (c. 1440-1400 BC). These were former slaves who needed to understand their identity, their God's nature, and their place in creation. They lived surrounded by Egyptian and Canaanite polytheistic cultures with competing creation narratives. Genesis 1 provided them with the authoritative account distinguishing YHWH from pagan deities.

### When was it originally composed?
If Mosaic authorship is accepted, composition occurred between c. 1440-1400 BC during the wilderness wanderings. The material may draw on older oral traditions or written sources passed down through the patriarchs. The final editing likely occurred over subsequent generations.

### When did the events take place?
The creation account describes events "in the beginning" (bereshit)—the absolute beginning of the created order. Various chronological frameworks exist: Young Earth interpretations place this c. 4000-6000 BC; Day-Age and Framework interpretations see the "days" as representing longer periods; Gap theories propose significant time between verses 1 and 2. The text itself emphasizes theological rather than chronological precision.

### What are some notable practices of the day?
Ancient Near Eastern cultures had elaborate creation myths recited during religious festivals (e.g., Enuma Elish recited during Babylonian New Year). Creation accounts served political and theological purposes, establishing the supremacy of patron deities. Temple dedications often paralleled creation language, as temples were seen as microcosms of cosmic order.

### What archaeology and external histories are associated with the passage?
- **Enuma Elish** (Babylonian creation epic): Features divine combat, splitting of Tiamat to form heaven and earth, creation of humans to serve gods
- **Atrahasis Epic**: Includes creation of humans from clay mixed with divine blood
- **Egyptian creation myths**: Ptah speaks creation into being (Memphis theology); Atum emerges from primordial waters (Heliopolis)
- **Sumerian creation accounts**: Multiple deities involved in creation through divine speech and craftwork

These parallels demonstrate shared cultural motifs while highlighting Genesis's distinctive monotheistic theology.

### What was the political-socio-economic milieu of that time? Social structures?
The Late Bronze Age context (if Mosaic): Egypt dominated Canaan politically; major empires (Egyptian, Hittite, Mitanni) vied for control. Society was hierarchical with kings claiming divine sanction. For Israel emerging from slavery, Genesis 1 was revolutionary—declaring all humans made in God's image challenged royal ideologies claiming special divine status.

### What were the circumstantial social norms, practices and issues of the day?
Polytheism was universal. Nature worship, astral religion (sun, moon, stars as deities), and fertility cults dominated religious life. Kings legitimized rule through divine ancestry claims. Genesis 1 systematically demythologizes these—sun, moon, and stars are merely "lights" created by God, not deities themselves.

### What geography is associated with the passage?
While Genesis 1:1-25 describes cosmic geography rather than specific locations, the worldview includes:
- **Heavens** (shamayim): The firmament/expanse separating waters
- **Earth** (eretz): The dry land
- **Seas** (yammim): Gathered waters
- **The Deep** (tehom): Primordial waters, linguistically connected to Tiamat but thoroughly demythologized

## Linguistic Analysis

### What was the original language of this writing?
Classical Biblical Hebrew, specifically the early form used in the Pentateuch. The creation account shows distinctive vocabulary and style that some associate with Priestly source material.

### What are the lexical semantics and range of the passage?

Key terms and their semantic ranges:
- **bara'** (בָּרָא, "create"): Used exclusively with God as subject; denotes bringing into existence, not merely shaping pre-existing material. Occurs in vv. 1, 21, 27.
- **'asah** (עָשָׂה, "make"): General term for making/doing; used alongside bara' (v. 7, 16, 25)
- **tohu wabohu** (תֹּהוּ וָבֹהוּ, "formless and void"): Describes the initial unformed state; rhyming pair emphasizing emptiness and chaos
- **ruach elohim** (רוּחַ אֱלֹהִים): "Spirit of God" or "wind of God" or "mighty wind"—ambiguity is debated
- **raqia'** (רָקִיעַ, "firmament/expanse"): From root meaning "to spread/beat out"; the dome separating waters
- **tov** (טוֹב, "good"): Encompasses aesthetic goodness, functional fitness, and moral approval

### What are some notable morphological and grammatical features of the passage?

1. **Opening phrase debate**: "Bereshit bara elohim"—is bereshit absolute ("In the beginning") or construct ("When God began to create")? The Masoretic vocalization suggests absolute, but syntax permits both readings.

2. **Elohim with singular verbs**: Elohim is morphologically plural but consistently takes singular verbs (bara, "he created"), establishing plurality of majesty, not polytheism.

3. **Waw-consecutive chains**: The narrative advances through vav-consecutive imperfects (wayyomer, "and he said"; wayhi, "and there was"), creating a rhythmic, propulsive structure.

4. **Jussive forms**: Divine commands use jussive mood ("let there be," yehi), expressing volition and command.

### What are the lexical-syntactical and discourse features of the passage?

- **Formulaic structure**: Each day follows a pattern—divine speech ("And God said"), fulfillment ("and it was so"), evaluation ("God saw that it was good"), temporal closure ("evening and morning, the Nth day")
- **Repetition**: The phrase "according to its/their kind" (lemino/leminah) occurs 10 times, emphasizing ordered categories
- **Merismus**: "Heavens and earth" encompasses totality through polar extremes
- **Anaphora**: Repeated "And God said" creates rhythmic emphasis on divine speech as the creative mechanism

### What is the etymology of key terms?

- **Bereshit** (בְּרֵאשִׁית): From rosh ("head/beginning"); the book's Hebrew name
- **Bara'**: Possibly related to Akkadian banû ("to build/create"); uniquely divine action in Hebrew
- **Tehom** (תְּהוֹם, "deep"): Cognate with Akkadian Tiamat but stripped of mythological personification
- **Yom** (יוֹם, "day"): Can mean 24-hour period, daylight portion, or extended period—context-dependent

### What are some notable translation decisions associated with this passage?

1. **Genesis 1:1-2 relationship**: Is v.1 an independent statement, a temporal clause subordinate to v.3, or a summary heading? Translations differ.
2. **"Spirit of God" vs. "wind from God"**: ruach can mean spirit, wind, or breath
3. **"Firmament" vs. "expanse"**: raqia' traditionally rendered "firmament" (following LXX stereoma); modern translations often use "expanse" to avoid implying solid dome
4. **"Good" (tov)**: Some translate "beautiful" or "fitting" to capture full semantic range

### What notable textual variants are there?

The Hebrew text of Genesis 1 is remarkably stable across manuscripts. Notable points:
- **LXX additions**: Some minor expansions for clarity
- **Samaritan Pentateuch**: Essentially agrees with MT in this section
- **Dead Sea Scrolls**: Fragmentary but confirm MT reading
- No major textual disputes affect interpretation of 1:1-25

## Literary Analysis

### What is the genre (and sub-genres) of the passage?

**Primary genre**: Theological narrative / Cosmogony (creation account)

**Sub-genre considerations**:
- **Elevated prose**: Not strictly poetry but highly structured, rhythmic prose with poetic features
- **Liturgical qualities**: The repetitive structure suggests possible use in worship
- **Polemic**: Implicitly counters ANE creation myths
- **Etiology**: Explains origins of cosmic order, Sabbath, and human vocation

The genre is unique—neither pure myth, scientific treatise, nor ordinary historical narrative, but a theological proclamation about origins.

### What is the literary structure of the immediate and surrounding?

**Days of Creation Structure (1:1-2:3)**:

The passage exhibits the "Framework Interpretation" structure:
- Days 1-3: Creating realms/spaces (forming)
- Days 4-6: Filling those realms with inhabitants (filling)

| Forming (Days 1-3) | Filling (Days 4-6) |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| Day 1: Light/Dark | Day 4: Sun, Moon, Stars |
| Day 2: Sky/Waters | Day 5: Birds, Fish |
| Day 3: Land/Vegetation | Day 6: Animals, Humans |

Day 7: Sabbath rest (climax outside our passage but completing the pattern)

**Verses 1-25 internal structure**:
- v.1: Summary statement/title
- v.2: Initial conditions (formless, void, dark, watery)
- vv.3-5: Day 1 - Light
- vv.6-8: Day 2 - Firmament
- vv.9-13: Day 3 - Land and vegetation
- vv.14-19: Day 4 - Luminaries
- vv.20-23: Day 5 - Sea creatures and birds
- vv.24-25: Day 6 begins - Land animals

### What is the voice, mood and style of the passage?

- **Voice**: Third-person omniscient narrator with divine perspective
- **Mood**: Majestic, ordered, confident, celebratory
- **Style**: Elevated, formal, liturgical quality; measured rhythm; repetition creates solemnity and memorability

### What rhetorical devices are used in the text?

1. **Anaphora**: "And God said" (10x in chapter)
2. **Epistrophe**: "And there was evening, and there was morning"
3. **Repetition**: Formulaic phrases create emphasis and aid memory
4. **Climax**: Building toward humanity (v.26ff) and Sabbath (2:1-3)
5. **Understatement**: Stars mentioned almost casually ("he made the stars also," v.16) despite their prominence in ANE religion

### What literary devices are used in the text?

1. **Parallelism**: Between forming days (1-3) and filling days (4-6)
2. **Chiasm**: Day 3 and Day 6 each have two creative acts, framing Days 4-5 with single acts
3. **Inclusio**: "Heavens and earth" in 1:1 and 2:1 bracket the account
4. **Merismus**: "Evening and morning" = complete day; "heavens and earth" = all creation
5. **Anthropomorphism**: God "sees," "separates," "calls"—divine actions described in accessible terms

### What are the characters and images in use? And their purpose in the passage?

**Characters**:
- **God (Elohim)**: The sole actor, transcendent yet involved Creator; speaks, sees, evaluates, names
- **The Deep/Waters**: Not personified opponents (contra ANE myths) but passive material

**Images**:
- **Light vs. Darkness**: Order emerging from chaos; later symbolic of good vs. evil
- **Waters above/below**: Cosmic structure; God controls what ancients feared
- **Vegetation "according to kind"**: Order, categories, fruitfulness
- **Luminaries as "signs"**: Time-keepers, not deities

### What numerology is in play here?

- **Seven**: The complete creation week; seven-day pattern structures entire account
- **Ten**: "And God said" occurs 10x in chapter 1 (divine speech = perfect completeness)
- **Three**: Day 3 and Day 6 each have double creative acts (3 is completion)
- **Two**: Pairs—light/dark, waters above/below, sun/moon, evening/morning

### What colors, items, etc. have significance?

- **Light** (or): First creation; later associated with divine presence and revelation
- **Waters**: Life-giving yet dangerous; controlled by God
- **Vegetation with seed**: Fruitfulness, perpetuation, blessing
- **Sun/Moon**: Demythologized—called "greater light" and "lesser light" rather than by names (shemesh/yareakh) associated with deities

## Theological Analysis

### What would the original audience have drawn from the passage?

For Israelites emerging from Egyptian bondage:
1. **YHWH's supremacy**: Their God created everything—including Egypt's "gods" (sun, Nile, animals)
2. **Anti-idolatry**: Nothing in creation is worthy of worship; all are mere creatures
3. **Ordered cosmos**: The world is not chaotic or arbitrary but designed with purpose
4. **Human dignity**: Preparation for the imago Dei declaration (v.26-27)
5. **Sabbath foundation**: Creation week establishes the rhythm they will observe
6. **Hope**: The God who ordered chaos can deliver and sustain them

### What spiritual disciplines are in play in the passage?

- **Worship/Doxology**: The text functions as a hymn celebrating God's creative power
- **Sabbath observance**: Rooted in creation's seven-day pattern
- **Meditation on creation**: Contemplating God through His works (cf. Psalm 19, Romans 1)
- **Trust/Faith**: Believing in an ordered, purposeful cosmos versus pagan fatalism

### What timeless principles are in view in the passage?

1. **God is sovereign Creator**: He exists before and independent of creation
2. **Creation by divine word**: God's speech is powerful and effective
3. **Goodness of creation**: Material world is inherently good, not evil or illusory
4. **Order and design**: Categories, kinds, and structures reflect divine wisdom
5. **God evaluates His work**: Divine intentionality and satisfaction in creating
6. **Distinction of Creator/creature**: Fundamental ontological divide

## Hermeneutic

### How does this passage fit within over-arching canonical threads and themes?

**Creation thread**: Genesis 1 → New Creation (Isaiah 65-66; Revelation 21-22)
- "Let there be light" → "The Lord will be your light" (Rev 22:5)
- First creation → New heavens and new earth

**Kingdom of God**: Creation establishes God's sovereign rule; the rest of Scripture traces its challenge (Fall), preservation, and restoration

**Christology**: John 1:1-3 deliberately echoes Genesis 1—"In the beginning was the Word... all things were made through him"
- Christ as agent of creation (Col 1:16; Heb 1:2)

**Temple theology**: Creation as cosmic temple; Genesis 1's structure parallels tabernacle construction
- Seven days / Seven speeches to Moses about tabernacle
- God "rests" in completed creation/temple

**Sabbath**: Creation week → Sabbath command (Exod 20:11) → Eschatological rest (Heb 4)

### What wordplay and/or idioms are in use?

- **Tohu wabohu**: Rhyming pair, onomatopoetic quality suggesting emptiness/chaos
- **Light (or) called Day (yom)**: Naming establishes dominion and definition
- **"Evening and morning"**: Hebrew day reckoned sunset to sunset
- **"According to its kind" (lemino)**: Technical formula for categorical boundaries

### What are some notable micro and macro-structures in the passage?

**Micro-structures**:
- Each day: Announcement → Command → Fulfillment → Evaluation → Temporal frame
- Days 3 and 6: Double commands (two acts per day)

**Macro-structures**:
- Prologue (1:1-2) → Six days → Epilogue/Sabbath (2:1-3)
- Movement from chaos to cosmos
- Movement from uninhabited to populated
- Forming (1-3) parallels Filling (4-6)

### What are the human image-bearer elements of the passage? Wisdom elements?

While 1:1-25 precedes the explicit imago Dei statement, it prepares for humanity's unique role:
- The world is prepared as a dwelling for humans
- Order and "goodness" declarations anticipate human evaluation and stewardship
- Vegetation and animals are created "according to kind"—humans will transcend this categorization

**Wisdom elements**:
- Creation by word reflects wisdom (Proverbs 8:22-31—Wisdom present at creation)
- Order and categories reflect divine wisdom embedded in creation
- Evaluation ("it was good") models wise assessment

### What is the plenary authorship intent in composing this text?

The divine Author (through human author) intends:
1. **To reveal God's nature**: Sovereign, transcendent, orderly, good, purposeful
2. **To establish worldview foundations**: Monotheism, creation ex nihilo (or at minimum by divine word), teleological cosmos
3. **To counter falsehood**: Polemical displacement of ANE myths and nature worship
4. **To ground Israel's identity**: Their God is Creator of all
5. **To establish Sabbath**: Creation week models covenantal rhythm
6. **To prepare for human vocation**: Days 1-5 set the stage for Day 6 climax

## Application

### Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience

Genesis 1:1-25 declares that the one true God brought all things into ordered existence by His powerful word. Unlike ancient myths of divine conflict or modern materialist claims of purposeless chance, this text proclaims that the universe is the intentional creation of a good, wise, and sovereign God. Everything from light to land to living creatures exists because God spoke it into being and declared it good.

### What attributes or actions, of the modern audience, must change according to this Word?

1. **From idolatry to worship**: We must not worship anything created—nature, celestial bodies, possessions, technology—but only the Creator
2. **From chaos-thinking to confidence**: We should trust that the world has order and purpose, not live as if everything is random
3. **From dualism to goodness**: We must not denigrate the physical/material world as inherently evil
4. **From pride to humility**: We are creatures, not autonomous beings; we exist by God's word
5. **From indifference to stewardship**: This is God's good creation, not ours to exploit carelessly

### When, where and how might we implement these changes?

- **Worship**: Regular corporate and private worship acknowledging God as Creator
- **Sabbath rhythm**: Practicing rest that honors the creation pattern
- **Creation care**: Environmental stewardship as honoring God's good work
- **Science with faith**: Engaging natural world study with wonder, not as competition with faith
- **Daily gratitude**: Recognizing daily provisions (light, food, life) as God's ongoing gifts
- **Counter-cultural witness**: Living out ordered, purposeful lives in a culture of chaos and meaninglessness

### Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?

The **meaning** is clear: God is Creator; all creation is good; we exist by His word and for His glory.

The **methods** vary by context:
- For intellectuals: Engage philosophy of origins, articulate creation theology coherently
- For practitioners: Develop daily rhythms acknowledging God's creative presence
- For leaders: Teach creation theology to combat both secular materialism and religious dualism
- For artists: Create works celebrating creation's beauty as reflecting divine creativity
- For scientists: Pursue research as "thinking God's thoughts after Him"
- For everyone: Daily practice of wonder, gratitude, and stewardship in ordinary life
