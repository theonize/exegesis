# Exegetical Analysis of Genesis 3:1-7 - The Temptation and Fall

## Historical & Cultural Analysis

### Who was the author?
Traditionally attributed to Moses, writing under divine inspiration during the wilderness period (c. 1440-1400 BC). Moses compiled the patriarchal traditions and divine revelation into the Pentateuch. His education in Egyptian royal courts exposed him to ancient Near Eastern creation and fall narratives, while his divine encounters at Sinai qualified him to record these foundational events. Whether drawing upon earlier written sources, oral traditions, or direct revelation, Moses shaped the authoritative account of humanity's temptation and fall.

### What was the original audience?
The Israelites in the wilderness and subsequent generations entering Canaan. These former slaves needed to understand not only their deliverance from Egypt but the fundamental human problem requiring deliverance—why humanity is alienated from God, prone to deception, and subject to death. Genesis 3:1-7 explained that humanity's brokenness stems not from their DNA or environment but from a catastrophic moral failure in Eden.

### When was it originally composed?
During the Mosaic period (c. 1440-1400 BC), though the events described are primordial—occurring at the dawn of human history before any human civilization. The narrative preserves the earliest account of human temptation and transgression, transmitted through generations before being inscripturated.

### When did the events take place?
In the primordial period immediately following humanity's creation—before recorded human history. This occurred while Adam and Eve still inhabited Eden, before their expulsion. The text presents these events as the hinge point of human history: what happened here explains everything that follows.

### What are some notable practices of the day?
Ancient Near Eastern cultures had extensive traditions regarding serpent symbolism, wisdom acquisition, and divine-human interaction:
- **Serpent symbolism**: Throughout the ANE, serpents were associated with both wisdom and chaos. Egyptian uraeus (cobra) symbolized divine authority; Mesopotamian serpent deities represented both healing and danger.
- **Wisdom traditions**: Acquiring wisdom or divine knowledge was a paramount pursuit—often through forbidden means (magic, divination, accessing restricted knowledge).
- **Divine gardens**: Sacred gardens associated with gods appear across ANE literature; access was typically restricted, guarded by supernatural beings.
- **Testing/probation**: Deities testing humans appears in multiple traditions (Adapa myth, Gilgamesh).

### What archaeology and external histories are associated with the passage?
- **Adapa Myth** (Mesopotamian): Adapa, a sage, is offered food that would grant immortality but refuses due to deception—loses eternal life through manipulation. Parallels Eve's deception regarding food and life/death consequences.
- **Epic of Gilgamesh**: A serpent steals the plant of immortality from Gilgamesh; serpent associated with lost immortality.
- **Egyptian texts**: The serpent as both protector (uraeus) and chaos embodiment (Apophis); tree imagery in paradise-like settings.
- **Cylinder seals**: Mesopotamian seals depict human figures, trees, and serpents in various configurations—though direct Eden parallels are debated.
- **No direct archaeological evidence** for the events, as they predate civilization; parallels demonstrate the story's antiquity and widespread echoes.

### What was the political-socio-economic milieu of that time? Social structures?
The narrative describes a pre-political, pre-economic state—Eden before human social structures developed. The only relationships were:
- **Vertical**: Humanity to God (covenant obedience/disobedience)
- **Horizontal**: Adam to Eve (marriage before corruption)
- **Environmental**: Humanity to creation (stewardship in the garden)
- **Adversarial**: The serpent introducing deception into an untainted system

The "fall" in this passage is the rupture that makes all subsequent social dysfunction possible.

### What were the circumstantial social norms, practices and issues of the day?
In the Edenic context:
- **Direct divine communication**: God walked in the garden (3:8); commands were personally delivered
- **One prohibition**: Only the tree of knowledge was forbidden (2:17)—radical freedom with one boundary
- **Naked without shame** (2:25): Moral innocence expressed in physical unselfconsciousness
- **No death yet**: The threat "you shall surely die" introduced mortality as consequence, not current reality
- **Serpent speech**: While unusual, the text presents it without Eve expressing surprise—either serpents originally communicated or a spiritual being used this creature

### What geography is associated with the passage?
- **Garden of Eden**: The paradisiacal setting planted by God "eastward in Eden" (2:8)
- **Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil**: Central geographical/theological feature—"in the midst of the garden"
- **Tree of Life**: Also in the garden's midst; access will be blocked after the fall (3:22-24)
- **The setting is enclosed**: A garden is a bounded, cultivated space—not wilderness

The geography emphasizes proximity and abundance: everything good was accessible except one tree. The temptation occurred within paradise, not outside it.

## Linguistic Analysis

### What was the original language of this writing?
Classical Biblical Hebrew, specifically the early form used in the Pentateuch. The passage displays narrative prose with embedded dialogue, showcasing the serpent's rhetorical sophistication and the narrator's careful word choices that carry theological weight. The Hebrew text is remarkably stable across manuscript traditions.

### What are the lexical semantics and range of the passage?

Key terms and their semantic ranges:

- **nachash** (נָחָשׁ, "serpent"): The snake; the root n-ch-sh also relates to divination, omens, and enchantment. Possibly connected to "bronze/copper" (nechosheth) suggesting brightness. The term carries connotations of cunning and danger.

- **'arum** (עָרוּם, "crafty/shrewd"): Describes the serpent in v.1; can be positive (prudent, Prov 12:16) or negative (cunning, crafty). Wordplay with 'arummim (עֲרוּמִּים, "naked") in 2:25 and 3:7—their nakedness is exposed when confronted by craftiness.

- **'aph** (אַף, "indeed/also"): Particle in serpent's opening question—"Did God really say...?" The particle introduces doubt and distortion.

- **tov wara'** (טוֹב וָרָע, "good and evil"): Merismus covering the entire spectrum of moral knowledge; knowing good and evil means comprehensive moral discernment—the prerogative of God and mature judges (2 Sam 14:17).

- **ta'avah** (תַּאֲוָה, "desire/delight"): From 'avah (to desire, crave); the tree was "desirable" (v.6)—appetite overcoming prohibition.

- **nechmad** (נֶחְמָד, "pleasant/desirable"): From chamad (to covet); appears in Tenth Commandment—the tree was "desirable to make one wise" (lehaskil).

- **lehaskil** (לְהַשְׂכִּיל, "to give insight/make wise"): Hiphil infinitive of sakal; the promise of wisdom/insight was the ultimate lure.

- **paqach** (פָּקַח, "opened"): Their eyes were "opened" (v.7)—fulfilled the serpent's promise (v.5) but with devastating irony; they saw their nakedness, not divine glory.

- **chagorah** (חֲגֹרָה, "loincloth/belt"): From chagar (to gird); they made "coverings"—the first human attempt to address the shame their sin produced.

### What are some notable morphological and grammatical features of the passage?

1. **Intensification in v.1**: The serpent is described as 'arum mikkol ("more crafty than all")—superlative construction emphasizing its exceptional cunning among all creatures.

2. **Distorted quotation**: In v.1, the serpent says "mikkol 'ets haggan" ("from any tree of the garden")—twisting God's generous permission into a restrictive prohibition; God had said "from every tree you may freely eat" (2:16).

3. **Addition by Eve**: In v.3, Eve adds "nor shall you touch it" (welo' tigge'u bo)—God said nothing about touching. She either strengthens the prohibition (fence around the law) or reveals uncertainty about God's actual command.

4. **Emphatic negation by serpent**: "lo'-mot temutun" (v.4, "you shall not surely die")—the serpent directly contradicts God's "mot tamut" (2:17, "you shall surely die"). The infinitive absolute + finite verb construction is negated entirely.

5. **Participle chain in v.6**: "tov...ta'avah...nechmad"—three participles describing the tree from three perspectives: good for food, delight to eyes, desirable for wisdom—comprehensive appeal.

6. **Waw-consecutive narrative**: "watere'...watiqach...wato'kal...watten...wayyo'kal...watippaqachnah" (v.6-7)—rapid-fire actions showing the swift progression from seeing to eating to sharing to consequence.

7. **Plural shift**: "Your eyes will be opened" (v.5, plural) addressing both, then fulfilled in v.7 "the eyes of both of them were opened"—they act as a unit in rebellion.

### What are the lexical-syntactical and discourse features of the passage?

**Discourse structure**:
- vv.1-5: Dialogue—Serpent and Woman (three exchanges)
- v.6: Narrative action—Woman takes, eats, gives
- v.7: Narrative consequence—Eyes opened, awareness, covering

**Serpent's rhetorical strategy**:
1. **Question to create doubt** (v.1): "Did God really say...?" ('aph ki-'amar)—questioning God's word
2. **Exaggeration**: Suggests God forbade all trees (when only one was forbidden)
3. **Direct contradiction** (v.4): "You shall not surely die"—flatly denies God's word
4. **Alternative narrative** (v.5): Reframes prohibition as God protecting His prerogatives from competitors

**Key syntactical features**:
- **Chiastic elements in Eve's response**: v.2-3 structures eating/not eating
- **Causal ki**: "For God knows" (v.5)—serpent provides the supposed reason for God's prohibition
- **Result clause**: "and you will be like God, knowing good and evil"—the promised outcome

### What is the etymology of key terms?

- **Nachash** (serpent): Possibly from root meaning "to hiss" or related to nachash ("to practice divination/observe omens"). May also connect to Akkadian "bashmu" (serpent) or reflect brightness (cf. seraph serpents, Num 21:6, 8).

- **'Arum** (crafty): From 'aram ("to be shrewd/prudent"); same consonants as 'erom ("naked")—the wordplay is intentional.

- **'Ets** (tree): Basic Semitic term for tree/wood; used for both the tree of life and tree of knowledge.

- **Da'at** (knowledge): From yada' ("to know"); encompasses experiential knowledge, not merely intellectual awareness. "Knowing good and evil" implies experiencing/determining good and evil.

- **'Enayim** (eyes): Dual form; eyes represent perception, understanding, desire—"pleasing to the eyes" (v.6) invokes physical and cognitive desire.

- **Te'enah** (fig): The fig tree leaves used for covering; specific identification may be significant—figs are among the earliest cultivated trees, associated with peace and prosperity.

### What are some notable translation decisions associated with this passage?

1. **Genesis 3:1 "crafty" vs. "shrewd" vs. "cunning"**: The Hebrew 'arum can be positive (prudent) or negative (crafty); context requires the negative sense, but translations vary: "cunning" (ESV), "crafty" (NIV), "shrewd" (NASB), "subtil" (KJV).

2. **"Did God really say?" (v.1)**: The Hebrew 'aph ki is difficult—"indeed that," "really," "even though." The serpent's tone is crucial: incredulity? feigned innocence? The phrase introduces doubt.

3. **"You will not surely die" (v.4)**: Hebrew lo'-mot temutun. Is the serpent denying death entirely or denying immediate death? The emphatic negation suggests total denial.

4. **"Knowing good and evil" (v.5, 7)**: Does this mean (a) moral discernment, (b) experiential knowledge of both, (c) autonomous moral judgment, or (d) comprehensive knowledge? Translations keep the phrase but interpretations vary.

5. **"Desirable to make one wise" (v.6)**: Hebrew nechmad lehaskil—"desirable for insight/success." Some translate "to be desired to make one wise" (KJV), "desirable for gaining wisdom" (NIV), "to be desired to make one wise" (ESV).

6. **"Knew that they were naked" (v.7)**: The verb yada' (know) connects to the tree of "knowledge" (da'at)—they gained knowledge, but what they knew was their vulnerability.

### What notable textual variants are there?

The Hebrew text of Genesis 3:1-7 is remarkably stable:

- **LXX (Septuagint)**: Translates 'arum as "phronimotatos" (most prudent/intelligent)—softer than "cunning." Translates "nachash" as "ophis" (serpent).

- **LXX on v.6**: Adds "and to her husband with her" (kai to andri autes met' autes)—emphasizing Adam's presence and complicity, which some argue is implied in the Hebrew.

- **Samaritan Pentateuch**: Essentially agrees with MT; no major variants in this passage.

- **Dead Sea Scrolls**: Fragmentary evidence confirms MT reading.

- **Targumim**: Interpret the serpent as speaking through supernatural agency; Targum Pseudo-Jonathan identifies the serpent with Sammael (angel of death).

- **Vulgate**: Translates 'arum as "callidior" (more cunning)—negative connotation.

- **Syriac Peshitta**: Generally follows MT closely in this passage.

The textual tradition is unanimous on the essential narrative; interpretive additions appear mainly in the Targumim.

## Literary Analysis

### What is the genre (and sub-genres) of the passage?

**Primary genre**: Theological narrative / Primeval history

**Sub-genres**:
- **Temptation narrative**: A specific type of testing scene where a character faces moral choice under external pressure
- **Dialogue**: The bulk of the passage (vv.1-5) is direct speech—a conversation that carries the theological weight
- **Etiology**: Explains why humans experience shame, why they hide from God, and why evil entered human experience
- **Tragedy**: In the classical sense—a fall from blessed state through a fatal flaw (here, doubting God's word and goodness)
- **Wisdom contest**: The serpent and woman engage in interpretation of divine command; it resembles wisdom literature's concern with discernment

The passage is neither myth (despite surface similarities to ANE stories) nor allegory (though richly symbolic), but historical theological narrative presenting real events with cosmic significance.

### What is the literary structure of the immediate and surrounding?

**Immediate context (Genesis 2:4-3:24)**:
- 2:4-25: Creation of man, garden, animals, woman; command given; marriage established
- **3:1-7: Temptation and Fall** (our passage)
- 3:8-13: Discovery and interrogation
- 3:14-19: Judgment pronounced
- 3:20-24: Grace and expulsion

**Structure of Genesis 3:1-7**:

```
A. Introduction of the serpent (v.1a)
   - Character and nature: "more crafty than any beast"

B. Dialogue: Three exchanges (vv.1b-5)
   1. Serpent's question—distorts God's command (v.1b)
   2. Woman's response—corrects but adds (vv.2-3)
   3. Serpent's denial and counter-narrative (vv.4-5)

C. The Fall: Threefold appeal, threefold action (v.6)
   - Appeal: good for food / delight to eyes / desirable for wisdom
   - Action: she took / she ate / she gave to her husband

D. Consequence: Eyes opened, shame realized (v.7)
   - Knowledge gained but corrupted
   - Covering attempted
```

**Chiastic relationship with Genesis 2**:
- 2:25: "naked and not ashamed"
- 3:7: "knew they were naked" (shame implied)
- 2:16-17: God's command with freedom
- 3:1-5: Serpent's distortion of command

### What is the voice, mood and style of the passage?

**Voice**:
- Third-person omniscient narrator who reports both external actions and internal perceptions
- Direct speech dominates (vv.1-5)—the narrator steps back to let the dialogue carry the drama
- Terse, understated narration of the fall itself (v.6)—the most catastrophic moment is described with devastating brevity

**Mood**:
- **Suspense**: The reader knows the prohibition; will she succumb?
- **Tragic inevitability**: The serpent's logic seems irresistible once engaged
- **Pathos**: The rapid collapse from innocence to shame
- **Dramatic irony**: The promised "wisdom" delivers only shame; eyes "opened" see nakedness, not glory

**Style**:
- **Economical**: Minimal description; maximum theological weight
- **Dialogical**: Truth and falsehood clash through conversation
- **Patterned**: Threefold structure in both temptation (v.6) and response
- **Understated climax**: "She took...ate...gave...he ate"—no embellishment at the moment of disaster

### What rhetorical devices are used in the text?

1. **Rhetorical question** (v.1): "Did God really say...?" — not seeking information but implanting doubt; questions God's word and character simultaneously

2. **Hyperbole/distortion** (v.1): The serpent exaggerates the prohibition ("from any tree")—making God appear unreasonably restrictive

3. **Antithesis** (vv.3-4): God said "you shall surely die"; serpent says "you shall not surely die"—direct contradiction framed as correction

4. **Reframing** (v.5): The serpent provides an alternative interpretation—God's prohibition isn't protection but suppression; not love but rivalry

5. **Tricolon** (v.6): Three descriptions of the tree (good/delightful/desirable) build to irresistible appeal

6. **Brevity at climax**: The most catastrophic action ("she took...she ate...she gave...he ate") is reported with shocking terseness—no dramatic pause, no hesitation recorded

7. **Irony**: The promise "your eyes will be opened" is fulfilled (v.7), but what they see is their own shame, not divine glory

### What literary devices are used in the text?

1. **Wordplay**:
   - 'arum (crafty) / 'arummim (naked)—the crafty one exposes their nakedness
   - nachash (serpent) / nachash (to divine/practice omens)—the serpent is the source of false wisdom

2. **Inclusio**:
   - 2:25: "naked and not ashamed"
   - 3:7: "knew they were naked"—nakedness frames the fall

3. **Foreshadowing**:
   - The serpent's craftiness foreshadows the cosmic conflict announced in 3:15
   - Fig leaves as covering anticipates the animal skins God provides (3:21)

4. **Parallelism**:
   - "Good for food" echoes 2:9 (trees "good for food")
   - "Desirable" (nechmad) echoes 2:9 ("pleasant to the sight")
   - What God gave freely becomes what they take illicitly

5. **Reversal**:
   - God said "freely eat" (2:16); they take from the one forbidden tree
   - They were to have dominion over creatures; a creature dominates them
   - Meant to rule, they are ruled by appetite

6. **Contrast**:
   - Serpent's many words / God's clear command
   - Promised wisdom / actual shame
   - Expected life "like God" / resulting death

7. **Understatement**: "She also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate"—Adam's catastrophic complicity is reported without comment

### What are the characters and images in use? And their purpose in the passage?

**Characters**:

- **The Serpent (nachash)**: More than an animal—later identified with Satan (Rev 12:9; 20:2). Functions as tempter, deceiver, theologian of lies. Speaks only here in Genesis; represents the intrusion of evil into the good creation. Purpose: embodies external temptation and demonstrates evil's strategy—questioning, distorting, denying, and reframing God's word.

- **The Woman (later Eve)**: Not yet named; simply "the woman" ('ishshah). She engages the serpent theologically, attempts to defend God's command, but is drawn into speculation and desire. Purpose: represents humanity's vulnerability to deception when entertaining doubt about God's word. Her threefold perception (v.6) shows the comprehensive nature of temptation.

- **The Man (Adam)**: Strikingly passive in the narrative—present ("with her") but silent. He receives from his wife and eats without recorded protest or dialogue. Purpose: represents complicit silence, failure to lead, abdication of responsibility. His fall is quieter but equally catastrophic.

- **God (YHWH Elohim)**: Present only in reported speech (what God said/knows). Absent during the temptation—testing requires the possibility of failure. Purpose: the reference point for truth that the serpent distorts and humans doubt.

**Images**:

- **The Tree**: Central image—beautiful, fruitful, forbidden. Represents the boundary between creature and Creator; the one limit in a world of freedom. Taking from it is grasping for autonomy.

- **Eyes opened**: Promised enlightenment; delivered shame. The image of sight represents knowledge, but what they "see" is their vulnerability.

- **Nakedness**: Innocence lost; shame experienced. Physical nakedness symbolizes spiritual exposure—they can no longer stand before God or each other unconcealed.

- **Fig leaves**: First human religious/moral effort—self-covering that proves inadequate. Represents human attempts to address sin's consequences apart from God.

- **Fruit**: Not identified as apple (later tradition); simply "fruit." Represents the tangible choice point—something seen, touched, eaten, shared.

### What numerology is in play here?

- **Three** exchanges in the dialogue (vv.1-5)—completeness of the temptation
- **Three** aspects of the tree's appeal (v.6): good for food, delight to eyes, desirable for wisdom—targeting body, soul, spirit
- **Three** actions by the woman (v.6): took, ate, gave—progressive steps of sin
- **Two** becoming one in sin: both eat, both experience opened eyes, both cover themselves
- **One** prohibition: among countless permitted trees, only one was forbidden—minimal restriction maximally violated

### What colors, items, etc. have significance?

- **The Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil**: Not just any tree but this specific tree. Later Scripture associates trees with life (Ps 1), wisdom (Prov 3:18), and ultimately the cross (Acts 5:30; 1 Pet 2:24). The forbidden tree stands as the boundary marker of creaturely limits.

- **Fruit**: Unnamed but tangible—represents the concrete nature of sin. Sin is not abstraction but action, taking what is forbidden. Later tradition's "apple" comes from Latin malum (apple/evil wordplay), not the Hebrew text.

- **Fig leaves**: Specifically identified (te'enah). Figs represent peace and prosperity elsewhere (1 Kgs 4:25; Mic 4:4). Their use for covering is ironic—symbols of blessing used to hide shame. Also notable: fig leaves are among the largest available in the region.

- **Eyes**: Mentioned three times—serpent's promise (v.5), fulfillment (v.7), and what they saw (nakedness). Eyes represent desire (v.6, "delight to the eyes"), knowledge, and moral perception.

- **Nakedness ('erom/'arummim)**: Bookends the passage through wordplay with 'arum (crafty). What was innocent (2:25) becomes shameful (3:7). Nakedness represents vulnerability, exposure, loss of glory.

- **Garden setting**: The temptation occurs in paradise, not wilderness. Sin enters at the point of greatest blessing, not greatest deprivation. This emphasizes sin's irrationality—they lacked nothing yet grasped for more.

## Theological Analysis

### What would the original audience have drawn from the passage?

For the Israelites receiving this text through Moses, Genesis 3:1-7 would have communicated several crucial truths:

**1. The Origin of Human Brokenness**
The original audience lived with the daily reality of sin, suffering, and death. This passage explained that these were not original to creation ("very good," 1:31) but resulted from human disobedience. Their bondage in Egypt, their struggles in the wilderness, their tendency toward idolatry—all traced back to this moment when humanity chose autonomy over obedience.

**2. The Nature of Temptation**
Israel faced constant temptation from surrounding cultures—Egypt behind them, Canaan before them. The serpent's strategy would have been recognizable: questioning God's word ("Did God really say...?"), offering alternative interpretations of divine commands, and promising benefits from disobedience. The nations around them perpetually offered "wisdom" and "knowledge" through forbidden means (divination, sorcery, idolatry).

**3. The Danger of Adding to God's Word**
Eve added "nor shall you touch it" to God's command. For an audience receiving Torah, this was instructive: God's commands should be neither diminished nor expanded by human addition. Both loosening and over-tightening God's word opens vulnerability to deception.

**4. The Folly of Trusting Creatures Over Creator**
Israel was tempted to trust in Egypt's gods, Canaan's baals, or their own wisdom rather than YHWH. The woman's trust in the serpent's word over God's word illustrated the fundamental error they must avoid. The creature led them to doubt the Creator.

**5. Sin's Corporate Dimension**
Adam's passive reception and eating showed that sin spreads—the woman gave to her husband, and he ate. Israel understood corporate solidarity; they would be blessed or cursed together based on covenant faithfulness. One person's sin affects the community.

**6. False Promises of Wisdom**
The nations offered "wisdom" through their religions; the serpent offered wisdom through disobedience. The original audience learned that true wisdom comes through fearing YHWH and keeping His commands (Deut 4:6), not through grasping forbidden knowledge.

### What spiritual disciplines are in play in the passage?

**1. Meditation on God's Word**
The serpent attacked through misquotation and distortion. The woman's vulnerability arose partly from imprecise knowledge of God's command (adding "nor touch it"). The discipline of accurately knowing, memorizing, and meditating on God's word is the defense against deception. "I have hidden your word in my heart that I might not sin against you" (Ps 119:11).

**2. Discernment**
The woman engaged the serpent's "theology" without discerning its source or trajectory. The discipline of testing words against God's revealed truth—not being "tossed about by every wind of doctrine" (Eph 4:14)—is essential. She should have recognized the contradiction and rejected it.

**3. Watchfulness/Vigilance**
The serpent approached subtly; evil rarely announces itself. The discipline of spiritual alertness—"be sober-minded; be watchful" (1 Pet 5:8)—guards against the enemy's approach. The woman entertained conversation she should have fled.

**4. Contentment**
Amid abundant provision (every tree freely available), the woman focused on the one forbidden tree. The discipline of contentment—gratitude for God's generous provision rather than fixation on what is withheld—protects against covetousness. "Godliness with contentment is great gain" (1 Tim 6:6).

**5. Accountability/Community**
Adam was "with her" but silent. The discipline of mutual accountability—speaking truth, protecting one another, confronting error—was absent. He should have spoken; she should have consulted him and God before acting.

**6. Fasting (Abstinence)**
At its core, God's command required abstinence from one tree—a form of fasting amid abundance. The discipline of saying "no" to legitimate (or illegitimate) desires strengthens the will and honors God's boundaries. They failed to exercise restraint.

**7. Prayer/Seeking God**
Notably absent: any consultation with God during the temptation. The discipline of bringing decisions, doubts, and temptations to God in prayer might have resulted in different choices. "If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God" (Jas 1:5).

### What timeless principles are in view in the passage?

**1. Sin Begins with Doubting God's Word**
The serpent's first move was "Did God really say...?" Before the fruit was eaten, God's word was questioned. This principle recurs throughout Scripture and human experience: departing from God's word is the first step toward departing from God. Orthodoxy (right belief about God's word) precedes orthopraxy (right practice).

**2. Sin Distorts Perception of God's Character**
The serpent reframed God as restrictive ("any tree"), deceptive ("you will not die"), and threatened by human advancement ("God knows..."). Sin always involves a corrupted view of God—seeing Him as harsh, untrustworthy, or withholding good. Right knowledge of God's goodness is protection against sin.

**3. Temptation Appeals to Legitimate Desires Illegitimately**
The tree was "good for food" (physical appetite), "delight to the eyes" (aesthetic desire), and "desirable for wisdom" (intellectual aspiration). These are legitimate desires—but pursued outside God's boundaries, they become sin. The principle: any good desire can become sinful when it overrides God's command.

**4. Sin Promises More Than It Delivers**
The serpent promised god-likeness and knowledge. They received shame, fear, and alienation. Sin always over-promises and under-delivers. The "pleasures of sin" are temporary (Heb 11:25); the consequences are lasting.

**5. Silence in the Face of Evil Is Complicity**
Adam was present ("with her") but said nothing. His silence made him a participant in the sin. Passive acquiescence to evil is not neutrality but culpability. Leaders especially bear responsibility to speak truth.

**6. Sin Spreads from Individual to Community**
The woman ate, then gave to her husband, then he ate. Sin is rarely contained; it spreads from person to person, generation to generation. "A little leaven leavens the whole lump" (Gal 5:9). One person's fall can bring down many.

**7. Human Efforts Cannot Cover Sin's Shame**
Fig leaves were the first human response to sin's exposure—insufficient, temporary, self-generated. Every human attempt to deal with guilt apart from God proves inadequate. Only God can truly cover sin (3:21 anticipates substitutionary atonement).

**8. Knowledge Without Obedience Brings Death, Not Life**
They gained knowledge—but it was knowledge of their nakedness, not divine wisdom. Information without submission to God produces corruption. True wisdom is inseparable from fear of the Lord.

**9. Autonomy from God Is the Essence of Sin**
"You will be like God, knowing good and evil"—the temptation was to moral autonomy, to be one's own judge of right and wrong. Sin at its root is declaring independence from God, setting oneself up as the authority. This is the opposite of faith.

**10. The Enemy's Strategy Is Consistent**
The serpent's approach—question, distort, deny, reframe—remains Satan's strategy. "The schemes of the devil" (Eph 6:11) follow predictable patterns recognizable from this first temptation. Understanding his methods enables resistance.

## Hermeneutic

### How does this passage fit within over-arching canonical threads and themes?

**1. The Seed Conflict**
Genesis 3:1-7 initiates what will become the central conflict of Scripture: the battle between two "seeds." Though 3:15 explicitly announces this enmity, the temptation narrative (3:1-7) is where the conflict begins. This thread runs through:
- Cain vs. Abel (Gen 4)
- The godly line vs. the ungodly (Gen 4-6)
- Israel vs. the nations
- Christ vs. Satan (Matt 4:1-11; Rev 12)
- The church vs. the serpent (Rev 12:17)

**2. The Word of God Questioned/Affirmed**
The serpent's attack began with "Did God really say...?" This establishes a canonical pattern:
- Satan attacks through questioning/distorting Scripture
- Faithfulness requires knowing and trusting God's word
- Jesus defeats temptation by citing Scripture accurately (Matt 4:4, 7, 10)
- The entire Bible is God's response to the serpent's question—"Yes, God really said..."

**3. The Second Adam**
Genesis 3:1-7 establishes Adam as the failed representative head. This demands a "second Adam":
- Where Adam was silent, Christ speaks truth
- Where Adam ate the forbidden fruit, Christ refused Satan's offers
- Where Adam's disobedience brought death, Christ's obedience brings life (Rom 5:12-21)
- Where Adam lost paradise, Christ regains it for His people

**4. Temptation's Threefold Pattern**
The tree was "good for food, delight to eyes, desirable for wisdom" (3:6). This pattern recurs:
- 1 John 2:16: "desires of the flesh, desires of the eyes, pride of life"
- Jesus' temptation (Matt 4): bread (flesh), kingdoms shown (eyes), throw yourself down (pride)
- The pattern reveals temptation's comprehensive appeal—body, soul, spirit

**5. Nakedness and Covering**
The shame/covering theme traces through Scripture:
- 3:7: Fig leaves (human effort—inadequate)
- 3:21: Animal skins (divine provision—requires death)
- Levitical system: Atonement (covering) through sacrifice
- Isaiah 61:10: Clothed with garments of salvation
- Revelation 3:18; 19:8: White garments, righteous deeds of saints
- Final state: Clothed in resurrection bodies (2 Cor 5:1-4)

**6. The Tree Connection**
Trees form a biblical-theological thread:
- Tree of knowledge: Instrument of fall
- Tree of life: Barred, then restored (Rev 2:7; 22:2)
- Trees of blessing: Righteous like trees (Ps 1)
- The cross as "tree" (Acts 5:30; Gal 3:13; 1 Pet 2:24)—Christ cursed on a tree to reverse the curse from a tree

**7. Eyes Opened—True and False**
"Your eyes will be opened" was fulfilled—but corruptly. This theme continues:
- Hagar: "God opened her eyes" (Gen 21:19)
- Balaam: "The LORD opened his eyes" (Num 22:31)
- Elisha's servant: "LORD, open his eyes" (2 Kgs 6:17)
- Emmaus road: "Their eyes were opened" (Luke 24:31)
- Blindness removed by Christ (John 9)
- True sight comes through God, not through grasping forbidden knowledge

**8. Wisdom: True and False**
The serpent offered wisdom through disobedience. Scripture's response:
- "Fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom" (Prov 9:10)
- Wisdom is personified and present at creation (Prov 8)
- Christ is "the wisdom of God" (1 Cor 1:24, 30)
- False wisdom is "earthly, unspiritual, demonic" (Jas 3:15)
- True wisdom comes through Christ, not through autonomous grasping

### What wordplay and/or idioms are in use?

**1. 'Arum / 'Arummim (Crafty / Naked)**
The serpent was 'arum (עָרוּם, crafty); the humans were 'arummim (עֲרוּמִּים, naked, 2:25). Same consonants, different vowels. The wordplay is devastating: the crafty one exposed their nakedness. What was innocent (naked without shame) became shameful when confronted by cunning.

**2. Nachash (Serpent / Divination)**
The noun nachash (נָחָשׁ, serpent) shares roots with the verb nachash (to practice divination, observe omens). The serpent represents false wisdom, forbidden knowledge acquisition—the very thing God's people were warned against (Deut 18:10).

**3. "Knowing Good and Evil"**
This phrase (yode'ei tov wara') is an idiom meaning comprehensive moral discernment—the capacity to determine right and wrong autonomously. It's used of:
- God (Gen 3:5, 22)
- Mature kings/judges (2 Sam 14:17; 1 Kgs 3:9)
- Children who haven't yet attained it (Deut 1:39; Isa 7:15-16)

The idiom implies that this knowledge belongs properly to God and delegated human authorities, not grasped by rebels.

**4. "Eating" as Appropriation**
Throughout Scripture, eating represents appropriation, incorporation, making something part of oneself:
- Eating from the tree = internalizing autonomy
- Eating the word (Jer 15:16; Ezek 3:1-3; Rev 10:9-10)
- Eating Christ's flesh (John 6:53-58)
- Passover meal, Lord's Supper—eating as covenantal participation

**5. "Eyes Opened"**
An idiom for gaining knowledge/understanding. But the fulfillment is ironic—what they "see" is their own nakedness. True eye-opening comes from God (Ps 119:18), not from disobedience.

**6. "You Will Be Like God" (ki'lohim)**
The phrase could mean "like God" or "like gods/divine beings." The irony: they were already made "in God's image" (1:27). The serpent offered what they already had—but in a corrupted, autonomous form.

### What are some notable micro and macro-structures in the passage?

**Micro-structures:**

**The Serpent's Rhetorical Progression (vv.1-5):**
```
Step 1: Question God's word (v.1b)
        "Did God really say...?"

Step 2: Distort God's word (v.1b)
        "...from any tree" (exaggeration)

Step 3: Deny God's word (v.4)
        "You will not surely die"

Step 4: Reframe God's motive (v.5)
        "For God knows...you will be like God"
```

**The Woman's Threefold Perception (v.6a):**
```
Appeal to body:    "good for food"
Appeal to soul:    "delight to the eyes"
Appeal to mind:    "desirable for wisdom"
```

**The Fall in Four Verbs (v.6b):**
```
watiqach  - she took
wato'kal  - she ate
watten    - she gave
wayyo'kal - he ate
```
Rapid, staccato action—the enormity of the moment compressed into four brief verbs.

**Macro-structures:**

**Chiastic Relationship with Genesis 2:**
```
A  2:16-17  God's command: "freely eat...but not this tree"
  B  2:25  "Naked and not ashamed"
  B' 3:7   "Knew they were naked" (shame)
A' 3:1-6  Serpent distorts command, they eat
```

**The Testing Pattern (repeated throughout Scripture):**
```
1. Divine command given
2. External tempter challenges
3. Internal desires aroused
4. Choice made (obedience or disobedience)
5. Consequences follow
```
This structure appears in Jesus' temptation (Matt 4), Israel's wilderness testing (Deut 8), Job's testing, and countless other narratives.

**Fall-Judgment-Grace Pattern (Genesis 3):**
```
A. Temptation and Fall (vv.1-7)
B. Investigation (vv.8-13)
C. Judgment (vv.14-19)
D. Grace (vv.20-21)
E. Expulsion with promise (vv.22-24)
```

### What are the human image-bearer elements of the passage? Wisdom elements?

**Image-Bearer Elements:**

**1. Rational Capacity**
The woman reasons, interprets, evaluates. She engages in theological dialogue—citing God's command, considering alternatives. This rationality is part of the imago Dei, but here it is corrupted by being directed against God's word rather than in submission to it.

**2. Moral Agency**
The passage presupposes genuine choice—they could have refused. Image-bearers are not robots but responsible agents. The fall reveals that moral agency can be exercised for evil as well as good.

**3. Aesthetic Perception**
"Delight to the eyes"—humans perceive beauty. This aesthetic capacity is God-like (He saw creation was "good"/beautiful). But aesthetic perception can lead astray when it overrides moral boundaries.

**4. Desire for Wisdom**
Wanting to be wise reflects the divine wisdom that ordered creation. But wisdom grasped autonomously, apart from God, becomes foolishness. The image-bearer element (wanting wisdom) is twisted into an image-destroying act.

**5. Relational Capacity**
The woman gives to her husband; he receives from her. They are social beings. But here, relationships become conduits for sin rather than reinforcements of righteousness.

**6. Communicative Ability**
Speech—image-bearers can dialogue, persuade, reason. The serpent uses speech to deceive; the woman uses speech to engage (when she should have refused); Adam uses no speech (when he should have spoken).

**Wisdom Elements:**

**1. Wisdom's Invitation vs. Folly's Invitation**
Proverbs 9 presents Woman Wisdom and Woman Folly both calling to the simple. Genesis 3 is the original Folly's invitation—promising wisdom but delivering death. The serpent embodies false wisdom's deceptive appeal.

**2. The Fear of the Lord**
Absent from the temptation is any fear of the Lord—the beginning of wisdom (Prov 9:10). The serpent removes fear ("you will not die") to enable transgression. True wisdom begins with taking God's word seriously.

**3. Discernment**
Wisdom discerns truth from falsehood, good from evil. The woman failed to discern the serpent's deception. The passage teaches the necessity of discernment—testing words against God's revealed truth.

**4. Consequences Foreseen**
"The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it" (Prov 22:3). The woman saw attraction but not danger. Wisdom calculates consequences; folly sees only immediate appeal.

**5. Counsel Sought**
Wisdom seeks counsel (Prov 11:14; 15:22). Neither consulted God; Adam did not counsel his wife to resist. The absence of godly counsel enabled the fall.

### What is the plenary authorship intent in composing this text?

Recognizing both human author (Moses) and divine Author (the Holy Spirit), the plenary intent of Genesis 3:1-7 includes:

**1. To Explain the Human Condition**
Why is the world broken? Why do humans sin, suffer, and die? This text provides the foundational answer: human rebellion against God's word introduced corruption into God's good creation. The divine Author ensures that all subsequent readers understand the root cause of their predicament.

**2. To Expose the Enemy's Strategy**
By recording the serpent's method—question, distort, deny, reframe—the Author equips God's people to recognize and resist deception in every age. The pattern is intentionally clear so that it can be identified when repeated.

**3. To Establish the Need for Redemption**
The passage creates the problem that the rest of Scripture solves. Without Genesis 3, there is no need for exodus, sacrifice, prophets, or Messiah. The Author sets up the narrative tension that only Christ can resolve.

**4. To Reveal Sin's Anatomy**
The text dissects how sin works: external temptation meets internal desire; doubt leads to desire, desire to decision, decision to action, action to consequence. This anatomy helps readers understand their own temptation experiences.

**5. To Demonstrate the Insufficiency of Human Solutions**
Fig leaves represent every human attempt to cover sin's shame apart from God. The Author shows their inadequacy to prepare for God's provision (3:21) and ultimately Christ's atonement.

**6. To Anticipate Christ**
Though explicit messianic promise comes in 3:15, the need for the "seed" who will crush the serpent is already evident in 3:1-7. Adam fails as representative head; a second Adam is needed. The divine Author writes with the end in view.

**7. To Warn Against Autonomy**
The essence of the temptation was "you will be like God"—autonomous moral judges. The Author warns every generation against the idolatry of self-sovereignty, the delusion that humans can be their own gods.

**8. To Teach the Primacy of God's Word**
The battle is over "Did God really say...?" The Author establishes that human wellbeing depends on receiving, trusting, and obeying God's word. This principle governs all subsequent Scripture.

**9. To Show Sin's Social Dimension**
The woman gave to her husband; he ate. Sin spreads. The Author reveals that no one sins in isolation—our choices affect others. This has implications for families, communities, and the human race.

**10. To Ground Redemptive History**
Everything that follows in Scripture—patriarchs, exodus, law, prophets, exile, return, incarnation, cross, resurrection, new creation—responds to what happened in Genesis 3:1-7. The divine Author ensures this foundation is solid for the entire redemptive edifice built upon it.

## Application

### Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience

Genesis 3:1-7 records the moment humanity fell from innocence into sin. A crafty serpent—later identified as Satan (Revelation 12:9)—approached the woman in the garden of Eden and questioned God's command about the forbidden tree. Through a calculated strategy, the serpent first distorted what God had said, then flatly contradicted God's warning about death, and finally reframed God's motive as selfish protection of divine prerogatives rather than loving provision.

The woman, finding the fruit attractive on multiple levels—physically appealing, aesthetically beautiful, and promising wisdom—took the fruit, ate it, and gave some to her husband who was with her. He ate without protest. Immediately, their eyes were "opened," but instead of experiencing the divine wisdom they expected, they became aware of their nakedness and felt shame, attempting to cover themselves with fig leaves.

**For modern readers, this passage reveals:**

1. **How temptation works**: The serpent's strategy—questioning God's word, exaggerating restrictions, denying consequences, and impugning God's motives—remains the pattern for every temptation we face. Recognizing these tactics helps us resist.

2. **Why we struggle**: Every human being inherits the effects of this moment. Our tendency to doubt God, desire autonomy, and rationalize sin traces back to Eden. We are not sinners because we sin; we sin because we are sinners—descendants of these first rebels.

3. **What sin actually is**: At its core, sin is not merely breaking rules but declaring independence from God. It is saying "I will decide what is good and evil for myself" rather than trusting God's word.

4. **Why human solutions fail**: The fig leaves represent every attempt to fix our brokenness through self-effort—religion, morality, self-improvement, therapy, achievement. All prove inadequate to cover the shame sin produces.

5. **Our need for rescue**: This passage creates the problem that the entire Bible addresses. If you've ever wondered why you need a Savior, Genesis 3:1-7 is the answer. Humanity broke what only God can fix.

### What attributes or actions, of the modern audience, must change according to this Word?

**1. From Casual to Careful with God's Word**

The serpent's attack began by questioning Scripture. Too many believers have only vague familiarity with what God actually says—making them vulnerable to distortion. We must know God's word accurately, not approximately. Eve's addition ("nor touch it") and the serpent's subtraction (ignoring God's generous provision) both opened doors to deception.

*Change required*: Move from passive exposure to active engagement with Scripture. Know what it says. Know what it doesn't say. Be able to recognize distortions.

**2. From Trusting Feelings to Trusting God's Character**

The serpent convinced Eve that God was withholding good from her—that His prohibition was not protection but oppression. When we feel God's commands are restrictive or His ways unfair, we are believing the serpent's lie about God's character.

*Change required*: When God's commands feel burdensome, remind yourself of His character: He is good, loving, wise, and for you. His "no" is always protective, never petty.

**3. From Entertaining to Fleeing Temptation**

Eve engaged the serpent in conversation. She examined the forbidden fruit, considered its appeal, and lingered long enough for desire to overcome conviction. We often do the same—flirting with temptation rather than fleeing it.

*Change required*: Stop entertaining what you should be escaping. "Flee from sexual immorality" (1 Cor 6:18). "Flee from idolatry" (1 Cor 10:14). Don't negotiate with temptation; run from it.

**4. From Passive Silence to Active Faithfulness**

Adam was "with her" but said nothing. His passive silence made him complicit in the disaster. Many believers watch sin unfold in their families, churches, and communities without speaking up—mistaking silence for peace.

*Change required*: Speak when you should speak. Protect those in your care. Refuse the cowardice that mistakes inaction for neutrality.

**5. From Autonomy to Submission**

The root temptation was "you will be like God, knowing good and evil"—moral autonomy, self-determination, being your own judge. Our culture celebrates this as freedom; Scripture reveals it as the original sin.

*Change required*: Surrender the throne of your life. Stop deciding for yourself what is right and wrong. Submit to God's word even when—especially when—it contradicts your preferences.

**6. From Self-Covering to God-Dependence**

Fig leaves were humanity's first attempt at self-salvation—and they failed. Every self-improvement project, every "I'll do better," every religious effort to earn favor repeats this futile pattern.

*Change required*: Stop trying to cover your shame yourself. Bring your nakedness to God, who alone can clothe you in Christ's righteousness.

**7. From Isolation to Accountability**

Neither Adam nor Eve sought God during the temptation. Neither sought each other's godly counsel. They fell because they faced the enemy alone—or worse, together in sin rather than together in resistance.

*Change required*: Build relationships of genuine spiritual accountability. Don't face major decisions or strong temptations alone. Invite trusted believers into your struggles.

### When, where and how might we implement these changes?

**Daily Practice: Morning Preparation**
- *When*: Each morning before engaging the world
- *Where*: In a consistent place of prayer and Scripture reading
- *How*: Read Scripture to know God's actual word (not vague impressions). Pray for discernment to recognize the serpent's strategies. Affirm God's good character before facing temptation. Consciously submit your day to God's authority.

**In the Moment of Temptation**
- *When*: The instant you recognize temptation's approach
- *Where*: Wherever you are—temptation doesn't wait for convenient settings
- *How*:
  - Identify the serpent's strategy: "Is this questioning God's word? Denying consequences? Reframing God's character?"
  - Counter with truth: "God actually said..." (quote Scripture)
  - Flee: Physically remove yourself if possible; mentally redirect immediately
  - Call: Reach out to an accountability partner in real-time

**In Family and Community**
- *When*: Regular rhythms—family devotions, small group meetings, one-on-one discipleship
- *Where*: Home, church, anywhere authentic community happens
- *How*:
  - Teach children to recognize temptation's patterns using Genesis 3
  - Practice asking each other: "What did God actually say about this?"
  - Create permission structures for speaking truth to each other
  - Confess struggles before they become falls

**In Decision-Making**
- *When*: Before major decisions (career, relationships, purchases, commitments)
- *Where*: In community with trusted advisors
- *How*:
  - Ask: "Is this decision moving me toward God's word or away from it?"
  - Test your desires: "Am I being drawn by legitimate good or forbidden fruit?"
  - Seek counsel: Don't decide alone what you should decide together
  - Wait: Urgency is often the serpent's pressure; wisdom can usually wait

**In Failure and Fall**
- *When*: Immediately after sin (don't let shame delay)
- *Where*: Before God in prayer; before trusted believers in confession
- *How*:
  - Don't make fig leaves—stop the self-justification
  - Come to God: "Against you, you only, have I sinned" (Ps 51:4)
  - Receive grace: Don't earn your way back; accept Christ's covering
  - Restore accountability: Bring others into your recovery

**In Spiritual Leadership**
- *When*: Whenever you have influence over others' faith
- *Where*: Pulpits, classrooms, homes, workplaces, friendships
- *How*:
  - Teach this passage: Help others recognize temptation's anatomy
  - Model vigilance: Be appropriately vulnerable about your own struggles
  - Don't be Adam: Speak up when you see others endangered
  - Point to Christ: The second Adam who succeeded where the first failed

### Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?

**The Meaning is Fixed:**
Genesis 3:1-7 reveals how sin entered humanity through doubting, distorting, and disobeying God's word. It exposes the enemy's strategy, the anatomy of temptation, and the inadequacy of human self-help. It points forward to humanity's need for a Redeemer who will crush the serpent's head.

**The Methods Are Flexible:**

*For the Intellectual Skeptic:*
- Engage apologetically: Genesis 3 explains the human condition better than any secular alternative
- Discuss: "Why do humans universally experience guilt and shame? Why do all cultures have moral codes we can't keep?"
- Present: The coherence of the biblical narrative—problem (Gen 3) demands solution (Christ)

*For the Struggling Believer:*
- Normalize the struggle: "Every temptation follows this pattern—you're not uniquely broken"
- Equip practically: Teach the four-step strategy and how to recognize each step
- Provide hope: The second Adam faced the same temptations and won; His victory is ours

*For the Legalist:*
- Challenge fig-leaf religion: "What are you doing to earn what Christ already purchased?"
- Expose the irony: Adding to God's word (like Eve did) doesn't protect; it makes more vulnerable
- Redirect: From self-effort to Christ-trust

*For the Licentious:*
- Warn seriously: "The serpent said 'you shall not die,' and he lied"
- Show consequences: Sin always promises more than it delivers
- Offer hope: The same passage that exposes sin points to the seed who crushes the serpent

*For Parents:*
- Teach early: This is foundational worldview material for children
- Use the pattern: When kids face temptation, walk through the serpent's steps
- Model confession: Let children see you own failure and receive grace

*For Small Groups:*
- Practice transparency: Create safe space to confess "this is where the serpent is attacking me"
- Pray specifically: For each other's specific temptation struggles
- Follow up: Accountability without follow-through is just public confession

*For the Preacher:*
- Preach the narrative: Let the drama unfold; don't just extract principles
- Point to Christ: Jesus faced the serpent in the wilderness and won
- Call to action: Specific, concrete application—not just "resist temptation" but "here's how"

*For Personal Devotion:*
- Memorize Genesis 2:16-17 and 3:1-7: Know the text the serpent distorted
- Journal temptation patterns: Where is the serpent working in your life?
- Pray Genesis 3 back to God: "Lord, show me where I'm doubting your word, where I'm believing lies about your character, where I'm reaching for forbidden fruit"

**The Bridge:**
The meaning remains constant; the method adapts to context. Whether teaching children, counseling addicts, discipling new believers, or preaching to the mature, Genesis 3:1-7 speaks. The serpent's strategy hasn't changed. Neither has the solution—not fig leaves we fashion, but the clothing God provides through the seed of the woman who crushed the serpent's head.
