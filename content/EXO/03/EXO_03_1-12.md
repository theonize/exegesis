# Exegetical Analysis of Exodus 3:1-12 - The Burning Bush

## Historical & Cultural Analysis

### Who was the author?
Traditionally attributed to Moses himself, who recorded his own call experience. The narrative has the quality of firsthand testimony—the detail, the dialogue, the internal hesitation all suggest autobiographical elements. Critical scholarship has identified this passage as containing elements from both the E (Elohist) source (use of "Elohim," "Horeb" for the mountain) and J (Yahwist) source (the revelation of YHWH). Regardless of source theory, the narrative was preserved as foundational to Israelite identity and Moses' prophetic authority.

### What was the original audience?
The Israelites during the wilderness wandering and subsequent generations who needed to understand the divine authorization of Moses' leadership and the nature of the God who delivered them. The narrative establishes that YHWH is not a new deity but the God of the patriarchs—Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—now revealing His personal name and initiating the covenant promises' fulfillment.

### When was it originally composed?
The events occurred during the late Bronze Age, approximately 1446 BC (early date) or 1290 BC (late date), depending on one's dating of the Exodus. The Mosaic authorship would place composition during the wilderness period (c. 1446-1406 BC or c. 1290-1250 BC). The narrative was certainly fixed in written form by the time of the united monarchy.

### When did the events take place?
Moses was 80 years old at the time of this encounter (Acts 7:30), having spent 40 years in Egypt and 40 years in Midian. If using the early Exodus date, this theophany occurred around 1446 BC; using the late date, around 1290 BC. Moses had been tending Jethro's flocks for approximately four decades when God interrupted his shepherd routine.

### What are some notable practices of the day?

**Shepherding as vocation**: Shepherding was a common occupation in the ancient Near East, particularly in semi-arid regions. It was considered lowly in Egyptian society (Genesis 46:34) but honored among Semitic peoples. Moses' forty years as a shepherd prepared him to lead Israel—shepherding became the dominant metaphor for leadership in Israel.

**Removing sandals on holy ground**: The command to remove sandals (v.5) reflects widespread ANE practice of showing reverence when entering sacred space. Bare feet symbolized humility, submission, and the acknowledgment that one stood on ground belonging to deity. Similar practices are attested in Mesopotamian and Egyptian religious contexts.

**The priest of Midian**: Jethro (also called Reuel) served as priest of Midian, indicating organized religious practice among the Midianites. Some scholars suggest Midianite worship may have included YHWH, providing background for Moses' encounter. The Kenite hypothesis proposes Moses learned YHWH worship from Midianites, though the text presents YHWH as the patriarchal God now newly revealing His name.

**Fire as divine manifestation**: Fire as theophanic medium was common in ANE religion. Fire represented divine presence, purity, power, and consuming judgment. The unconsumed bush was unique—divine fire that illuminated without destroying, suggesting a God who dwells with His people without consuming them in their sinfulness.

### What archaeology and external histories are associated with the passage?

**Midianite territory**: Archaeological surveys have identified Midianite occupation in northwestern Arabia and the eastern Sinai during the Late Bronze Age. Midianite pottery (Qurayyah painted ware) has been found throughout the region, confirming the existence and extent of Midianite culture.

**Mount Horeb/Sinai location**: The traditional location at Jebel Musa in the southern Sinai Peninsula has been accepted since the 4th century AD. However, some scholars argue for a location in Midian proper (northwestern Arabia), based on the text stating Moses was tending flocks in Midian when he came to "the mountain of God." Jebel al-Lawz in Saudi Arabia has been proposed as an alternative.

**Egyptian records**: While no Egyptian records directly mention Moses or the Exodus, the Merneptah Stele (c. 1208 BC) contains the earliest extrabiblical reference to Israel as a people in Canaan. Egyptian records do document Semitic slaves in Egypt and their use in building projects.

**Hittite references**: The passage mentions Hittites among the Canaanite peoples (v.8). Archaeological discoveries in the 19th-20th centuries confirmed the Hittite civilization's existence, vindicating the biblical references once thought mythical.

### What was the political-socio-economic milieu of that time?

**Egyptian New Kingdom**: Egypt was at the height of its imperial power during the 18th-19th Dynasties. Ramesses II (if using late date) was conducting massive building projects requiring extensive labor, fitting the context of Israelite oppression. Egypt controlled Canaan as vassal territory.

**Midianite society**: The Midianites were semi-nomadic pastoralists organized in tribal confederations. Jethro's role as priest suggests a theocratic element in tribal leadership. Trade routes passing through Midian connected Egypt, Arabia, and Mesopotamia.

**Canaanite city-states**: The land promised to Israel (v.8) was occupied by various people groups organized in city-states under Egyptian suzerainty. The Amarna Letters (14th century BC) reveal the political fragmentation and instability of Canaan during this period.

**Social structure**: Moses occupied a liminal position—raised as Egyptian royalty but now a fugitive shepherd in Midian, married into a priestly family. His multiple identities (Hebrew, Egyptian, Midianite) uniquely prepared him for mediating between cultures.

### What were the circumstantial social norms, practices and issues of the day?

**Slavery and forced labor**: The Israelites' condition in Egypt involved harsh slavery ('avodah) and forced labor building storage cities. Egyptian practice routinely used foreign captives and resident aliens for state projects.

**Fugitive status**: Moses was a wanted man in Egypt, having killed an Egyptian taskmaster (Exodus 2:11-15). His flight to Midian followed ancient patterns of political refugees seeking asylum in distant territories.

**Divine commissioning**: The call narrative follows patterns known from other ANE texts where deities commission human agents for specific tasks. The dialogue structure—divine call, human objection, divine reassurance—became the template for prophetic call narratives.

**Blood and kinship**: God identifies Himself through ancestral connection ("God of your father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob"), emphasizing covenant continuity and kinship obligation to deliver blood relatives from oppression.

### What geography is associated with the passage?

**Midian**: Located in northwestern Arabia, east of the Gulf of Aqaba. Moses had fled here forty years earlier and married Zipporah, daughter of the Midianite priest.

**Horeb/Sinai ("the mountain of God")**: The text identifies this as "the mountain of God" even before the theophany, suggesting prior sacred associations. Whether in the Sinai Peninsula or Arabian Peninsula, it was a remote wilderness location west ("behind") of Midian proper.

**The wilderness (midbar)**: The semi-arid steppe suitable for grazing flocks. Moses led his flock "beyond" or "behind" the wilderness—deeper into uninhabited territory where the theophany occurred.

**The land of Canaan (v.8)**: Described as "a good and spacious land, flowing with milk and honey"—the promised inheritance. The peoples listed (Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites) represent the full extent of the territory from the Mediterranean to the Jordan.

**Egypt**: The place of Israel's bondage, ruled by Pharaoh. Moses is commissioned to return there—to the very place he had fled as a fugitive.

## Linguistic Analysis

### What was the original language of this writing?
Classical Biblical Hebrew, exhibiting features characteristic of early Hebrew prose narrative. The passage contains some of the most theologically significant Hebrew vocabulary in Scripture, including the divine self-revelation that would define Israel's understanding of God.

### What are the lexical semantics and range of the passage?

Key terms:

**seneh (bush)**: A thorny bush, occurring only here (vv.2-4) and in Deuteronomy 33:16 in all of Scripture. The word likely involves deliberate wordplay with "Sinai" (sinay), creating a phonetic connection between the bush and the mountain. This may represent a folk etymology explaining why the mountain is called Sinai.

**bo'er (burning)**: From the root ba'ar, meaning "to burn, consume." The participle describes ongoing burning—the bush was continuously burning yet not consumed. This paradox signals supernatural phenomena.

**'ukal (consumed)**: From 'akal, "to eat, devour, consume." Fire normally "eats" or "devours" its fuel. The negative (eynenu 'ukal) emphasizes the miraculous—the fire was real but did not consume.

**'adamat qodesh (holy ground)**: Literally "ground of holiness." The construct state indicates that holiness belongs to the ground itself because of divine presence. This is the first use of qodesh (holy) in the Bible, establishing the concept of sacred space.

**mal'ak YHWH (angel of the LORD)**: This phrase introduces ambiguity—is it a created messenger or YHWH Himself in visible form? The narrative shifts seamlessly between "the angel of YHWH" (v.2) and "YHWH" and "Elohim" (vv.4-6), suggesting theophanic presence rather than mere angelic visitation.

**'ehyeh 'asher 'ehyeh (I AM WHO I AM)**: The most significant phrase in the passage, appearing in v.14 as God's self-identification. 'Ehyeh is the first-person singular imperfect of hayah (to be). The phrase has been translated variously: "I am who I am," "I will be what I will be," "I am the One who is," "I will be present as I will be present."

**YHWH (the LORD)**: The Tetragrammaton, the personal name of God, related etymologically to 'ehyeh. YHWH is the third-person form ("He is/will be") corresponding to the first-person 'ehyeh ("I am/will be"). This is presented as God's "name forever" and "memorial name" to all generations.

### What are some notable morphological and grammatical features of the passage?

1. **Imperfect aspect in divine naming**: 'Ehyeh uses the imperfect (yiqtol) form, which in Hebrew indicates incomplete action—ongoing, continuous, or future. This grammatical choice emphasizes God's eternal, ongoing existence and His dynamic presence with His people.

2. **Wayyiqtol narrative chain**: The passage employs the characteristic Hebrew narrative sequence (wayyiqtol) to advance the story: "and he led... and he came... and there appeared... and he saw... and he said..."

3. **Cohortative of purpose**: "Let me turn aside" ('asurah-na') uses the cohortative mood expressing intention and desire—Moses' self-deliberation before approaching.

4. **Emphatic infinitive absolute**: In several places, Hebrew uses the infinitive absolute for emphasis. God's promise "I will certainly be with you" (v.12) employs this construction.

5. **Construct chains**: Multiple construct phrases create theological density: "mountain of God," "angel of YHWH," "God of your father," "God of Abraham."

6. **Repetition for emphasis**: The threefold "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob" (v.6) uses repetition to establish continuity with patriarchal promises.

### What are the lexical-syntactical and discourse features of the passage?

**Dialogue structure**: The passage alternates between narrative description and direct speech. The divine speeches dominate, establishing God as the primary actor while Moses responds with questions and objections.

**Question-answer pattern**: Moses asks "Who am I?" (v.11), setting up the divine response. This pattern of human inadequacy met by divine assurance becomes paradigmatic for prophetic call narratives.

**Chiastic elements in vv.7-10**:
- A: I have surely seen the affliction (v.7a)
  - B: I have heard their cry (v.7b)
    - C: I know their sufferings (v.7c)
    - C': I have come down to deliver them (v.8a)
  - B': The cry has come to me (v.9)
- A: I have seen the oppression (v.9b)

**Framing by divine speech**: God's words open (v.4) and close (v.12) the main theophanic section, with Moses' words embedded within divine discourse.

### What is the etymology of key terms?

**Horeb (Chorev)**: From the root charav, meaning "to be dry, desolate." The name emphasizes the wilderness character of the location—a desolate, dry mountain.

**Sinai**: Etymology uncertain. Possibly connected to the Mesopotamian moon god Sin, suggesting pre-Israelite sacred associations. The wordplay with seneh (bush) may be the narrator's explanation.

**YHWH**: Derived from the root hayah (to be). The name may mean "He is," "He causes to be," "He who is," or "He who will be present." The connection to 'ehyeh in v.14 is explicit—God's name encapsulates His eternal, self-existent being and His covenant faithfulness.

**Moses (Mosheh)**: Egyptian origin, from ms meaning "child" or "born of" (as in Thutmose, Rameses). The Hebrew folk etymology in Exodus 2:10 connects it to mashah (to draw out), anticipating his role in drawing Israel out of Egypt.

**Midian**: From the Hebrew root meaning "strife" or "judgment." One of Abraham's sons through Keturah (Genesis 25:2).

### What are some notable translation decisions associated with this passage?

1. **"I AM WHO I AM" vs. "I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE"**: The Hebrew imperfect allows both readings. Most English translations use present tense ("I AM"), following LXX (ego eimi ho on) and emphasizing eternal existence. Some scholars prefer future tense ("I will be"), emphasizing God's dynamic presence and covenant faithfulness—He will be present as He will be present.

2. **"Angel of the LORD" vs. theophany**: The Hebrew mal'ak YHWH could be translated "messenger of YHWH" (emphasizing a distinct being) or understood as YHWH Himself in visible form (theophany). The narrative's interchangeable use of "angel," "YHWH," and "Elohim" supports the theophanic reading.

3. **"Bush" (seneh)**: Some translate more specifically as "thornbush" or "bramble" to capture the lowly, common nature of the plant—God appears not in a mighty cedar but in a common desert shrub.

4. **"Holy ground"**: The Hebrew 'adamat qodesh could also be rendered "ground of holiness" or "consecrated ground," emphasizing that God's presence makes ordinary ground sacred.

5. **"The back of the wilderness"**: Hebrew 'achar hamidbar is variably rendered "far side," "west side," "back," or "beyond" the wilderness. The directional term assumes an eastern orientation (facing east), making "behind" equivalent to "west."

### What notable textual variants are there?

**Septuagint (LXX) rendering of 'ehyeh**: The LXX translates 'ehyeh 'asher 'ehyeh as ego eimi ho on ("I am the One who is" or "I am the Being"). This translation influenced Greek philosophy's understanding of God as pure Being and shaped Christian theological formulations.

**Samaritan Pentateuch**: Generally agrees with the Masoretic Text in this passage, with minor orthographic variations.

**Dead Sea Scrolls**: Fragments from Qumran (4QExod) preserve portions of Exodus 3 with close agreement to the MT.

**Verse numbering**: The pericope is consistently defined across traditions, though some include through v.15 or extend to v.22 as a complete call narrative unit.

**Divine name pronunciation**: The original vocalization of YHWH was lost. "Yahweh" is a scholarly reconstruction; "Jehovah" arose from combining YHWH consonants with Adonai vowels. The LXX consistently renders it as Kyrios (Lord).

## Literary Analysis

### What is the genre (and sub-genres) of the passage?

**Primary genre**: Theophanic Call Narrative

**Sub-genres**:
- **Theophany**: A manifestation of God in visible, perceptible form. The burning bush is one of Scripture's paradigmatic theophanies, establishing patterns for subsequent divine appearances.
- **Commission/Call narrative**: The passage follows the classic pattern of prophetic commissioning: divine encounter, commission, objection, reassurance, sign. This structure reappears in Isaiah 6, Jeremiah 1, and Ezekiel 1-3.
- **Etiological narrative**: The passage explains the origin and meaning of the divine name YHWH and establishes the sacred character of the mountain.
- **Dialogue**: Extended divine-human conversation dominates the passage, with God speaking most of the words while Moses questions and objects.

### What is the literary structure of the immediate and surrounding?

**Broader context**:
- Exodus 1: Israel's oppression in Egypt
- Exodus 2:1-10: Birth and rescue of Moses

    C'. Divine reassurance: "I will be with you" (v.12a)
  B'. The sign: worship on this mountain (v.12b)
A'. [Implied return to this mountain with Israel]
```

### What is the voice, mood and style of the passage?

**Voice**: Third-person omniscient narrator who describes external events and Moses' internal deliberation ("I will turn aside to see"). The narrator yields to extensive direct speech by God, giving the passage a dialogical quality.

**Mood**:
- **Numinous and awe-filled**: The burning bush creates wonder; Moses hides his face in fear.
- **Urgent and purposeful**: God has heard, seen, known—and now acts. The divine speeches pulse with purpose.
- **Intimate yet majestic**: God speaks directly to Moses by name, yet the ground itself becomes holy at His presence.
- **Reassuring despite fear**: Moses fears, but God answers objections with promises.

**Style**:
- **Economical yet profound**: Sparse narrative description surrounds theologically dense dialogue.
- **Repetitive for emphasis**: "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob" hammers home covenant continuity.
- **Question-and-answer**: The human questions ("What shall I say?") structure the divine self-revelation.
- **Paradoxical**: Fire that doesn't consume; a God who is wholly other yet intimately present.

### What rhetorical devices are used in the text?

1. **Repetition (anaphora)**: "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob" creates rhythmic emphasis on covenant continuity.

2. **Paradox**: The burning bush itself is paradoxical—fire without consumption. This paradox signals that normal categories don't apply; God is present.

3. **Question and response**: Moses' questions ("Who am I?" and later "What is Your name?") become vehicles for divine self-revelation. God uses human inadequacy to reveal divine sufficiency.

4. **Irony**: Moses, who was "drawn out" of water, will draw Israel out of Egypt. The shepherd of sheep will shepherd God's people. The fugitive will confront Pharaoh.

5. **Inclusio**: The "mountain of God" frames the passage—Moses comes to it (v.1) and will return with Israel (v.12).

6. **Pathos**: God's speech in vv.7-9 accumulates emotional weight: "I have seen... heard... know their sufferings... I have come down to deliver."

### What literary devices are used in the text?

1. **Wordplay**: seneh (bush) and Sinai (mountain) create phonetic connection, binding the theophany to the place name.

2. **Symbolism**: The bush that burns without being consumed symbolizes Israel's suffering that cannot destroy them, God's presence that doesn't consume sinful people, and divine glory that illuminates without annihilating.

3. **Foreshadowing**: The fire theophany anticipates the pillar of fire, Mount Sinai's fire, and the consuming fire of God's presence throughout Exodus.

4. **Type-scene**: The theophany at the bush establishes patterns that recur—God appears, speaks, commissions, reassures, provides signs.

5. **Contrast**: Egypt (place of bondage) vs. Canaan (land flowing with milk and honey); Pharaoh's throne vs. the humble bush; human inadequacy ("Who am I?") vs. divine sufficiency ("I will be with you").

6. **Dialogue as revelation**: The back-and-forth conversation reveals divine character—a God who speaks, listens, answers objections, and accommodates human weakness.

### What are the characters and images in use? And their purpose in the passage?

**Characters**:

**Moses**: The reluctant prophet, now 80 years old, transformed from Egyptian prince to Midianite shepherd. His question "Who am I?" reveals genuine humility (or perhaps false humility)—he knows his inadequacy. Yet he is being prepared for the greatest human leadership role in the Old Testament. His multiple identities (Hebrew, Egyptian, Midianite) uniquely qualify him as mediator.

**God (YHWH/Elohim/Angel of YHWH)**: The central character who initiates, speaks, commissions, and reassures. God is presented as:
- The covenant God of the patriarchs (continuity)
- The God who sees, hears, knows, and comes down (compassion)
- The God who sends and accompanies (commission)
- The "I AM"—self-existent, eternal, present

**Jethro (mentioned)**: Moses' father-in-law, priest of Midian, provides context for Moses' current life situation.

**Israel (mentioned)**: The suffering people whose cry has reached God—they are the object of divine compassion and the people Moses must lead.

**Pharaoh (mentioned)**: The oppressor, representing human power that God will overcome.

**Images**:

**The burning bush**: Central image—common thornbush ablaze with divine fire yet unconsumed. Symbolizes God's presence with His suffering people (Israel in Egypt's fire but not destroyed), God's holiness that doesn't destroy those He chooses, and the mystery of divine transcendence meeting created reality.

**Fire**: Represents divine presence, holiness, purity, and power. Fire illuminates, warms, purifies, and can consume. God's fire does all but the last—He is present but does not destroy.

**Holy ground**: Ordinary desert soil made sacred by divine presence. Establishes that holiness is not inherent to places but conferred by God's presence.

**The removed sandals**: Symbol of humility, submission, and recognition of sacred space. Moses' bare feet connect directly with holy ground.

**The mountain**: Place of divine encounter, later becoming central to Israel's identity at Sinai.

### What numerology is in play here?

**Forty years**: Moses spent forty years in Egypt, forty years in Midian, and would spend forty years in the wilderness. The number forty represents a complete period of testing, preparation, or judgment.

**Eighty years old**: Moses' age at the call (40 + 40). He was at the midpoint of his 120-year life, with his most significant work still ahead.

**Three patriarchs**: "God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob"—the threefold repetition emphasizes completeness and covenant continuity through three generations.

**Six nations listed (v.8)**: Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, Jebusites. (Some texts add Girgashites for seven, the number of completeness.)

**The dual naming**: "Moses, Moses!" (v.4)—the doubled name signifies urgency and intimate address (cf. "Abraham, Abraham" in Genesis 22:11; "Samuel, Samuel" in 1 Samuel 3:10).

### What colors, items, etc. have significance?

**Fire**: Though no color is named, fire evokes red, orange, gold—the colors of divine glory. Fire represents YHWH's presence throughout Exodus (pillar of fire, Sinai ablaze, glory filling tabernacle).

**The bush (seneh)**: A common, lowly thornbush—not a mighty tree. God's choice of this humble vessel prefigures the pattern of divine election: not the impressive but the lowly.

**Sandals**: Ordinary footwear that must be removed. The sandals represent the common, everyday world that must be set aside when encountering the holy.

**Ground/Dust ('adamah)**: The earth itself, from which humanity was formed. Even common ground becomes sacred when God is present.

**Flock**: Moses' sheep represent his current humble vocation and anticipate his future role as shepherd of God's flock.

**Milk and honey**: The description of Canaan as "flowing with milk and honey" evokes abundance, fertility, and covenant blessing—pastoral and agricultural prosperity combined.

## Theological Analysis

### What would the original audience have drawn from the passage?

For the Israelites in Egypt and the wilderness, this narrative established several foundational truths:

**1. God Had Not Forgotten Them**
After 400 years in Egypt, the Israelites might have wondered if the God of their ancestors still remembered them. This passage emphatically answers: God has seen their affliction, heard their cry, known their sufferings, and come down to deliver. The covenant promises to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob remained in force.

**2. Their God Had a Personal Name**
The revelation of the divine name YHWH was momentous. Unlike the generic "El" (god) or "Elohim" (gods/God), YHWH was Israel's God's personal, covenant name. This God could be known, called upon, and related to personally. The name carried the weight of God's eternal, self-existent being and His promise to be present with His people.

**3. Divine Authorization of Moses**
The burning bush commissioning established Moses' authority. He did not appoint himself; God called him. His message came not from human wisdom but divine revelation. Any who questioned Moses' leadership questioned the God who sent him.

**4. The God Who Condescends**
The original audience would have marveled that the eternal God spoke through a common thornbush to a shepherd-fugitive. God did not appear in Egyptian splendor but in wilderness simplicity. This God comes down to His people's level.

**5. Holiness as Presence**
The command to remove sandals because the ground was holy taught that holiness is not about special locations but divine presence. Wherever God is, there is holy ground. This prepared Israel for the portable sanctuary—God's presence making any wilderness spot sacred.

**6. Deliverance as God's Work**
The repeated "I" statements—"I have seen," "I have heard," "I have come down," "I will send," "I will be with you"—emphasize that deliverance is God's work. Human agency (Moses) is involved but subordinate to divine initiative.

### What spiritual disciplines are in play in the passage?

**1. Attentiveness / Watchfulness**
Moses noticed the bush—"I will turn aside to see this great sight." Spiritual attentiveness involves watching for God's activity in ordinary circumstances. Moses could have walked past; instead, he turned aside. The discipline of noticing God's presence requires intentional attention.

**2. Reverent Approach**
The removal of sandals represents the discipline of reverence—approaching God with appropriate humility and awe. We do not rush into divine presence casually but recognize the holiness of the One we approach.

**3. Listening / Hearing**
God called, "Moses, Moses!" and Moses answered, "Here I am" (hineni). The discipline of listening—presenting oneself before God, attentive and available—precedes commission. Hineni expresses readiness to receive and respond.

**4. Obedience Despite Fear**
Moses was afraid to look at God (v.6), yet he remained and listened. The discipline of obedient presence—staying in God's presence despite discomfort—opens us to further revelation.

**5. Honest Questioning**
Moses' objection "Who am I?" represents the discipline of honest engagement with God. Moses did not pretend confidence he lacked. Authentic relationship with God includes bringing our doubts and inadequacies before Him.

**6. Trust in Divine Promise**
The passage calls for the discipline of trusting God's word. "I will be with you" must be believed before it is experienced. Moses must act on promise before seeing fulfillment.

### What timeless principles are in view in the passage?

**1. God Sees, Hears, and Knows Human Suffering**
The triple affirmation—"I have seen... heard... know"—establishes that God is not distant or indifferent. Human suffering does not escape divine notice. This truth sustains the afflicted and calls the comfortable to action.

**2. God Initiates; Humans Respond**
Moses did not seek God; God appeared to Moses. The burning bush was unsought, unexpected, undeserved. Grace precedes human action. We respond to God's initiative; we do not generate it.

**3. God Calls the Inadequate and Equips Them**
Moses' objection "Who am I?" receives no direct answer about Moses' qualifications. Instead, God says, "I will be with you." Divine calling does not depend on human adequacy but divine presence. God does not call the qualified; He qualifies the called.

**4. Holiness Is Conferred by Presence**
The ground was not inherently holy; it became holy because God was there. This principle applies to persons, places, and things—holiness is not earned or achieved but conferred by God's presence and consecration.

**5. God Reveals Himself Progressively**
God identifies Himself first through ancestral connection (God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob), then through His personal name (YHWH), then through His character (the God who sees, hears, delivers). Divine self-revelation unfolds in stages as humans are able to receive it.

**6. Commission Includes Promise**
God's call never leaves us alone. "I will be with you" accompanies "I am sending you." Divine commission always includes divine enabling. We are not sent out abandoned.

**7. The Sign Often Follows the Obedience**
The sign given to Moses (v.12)—"you shall worship God on this mountain"—would only be fulfilled after Moses obeyed. The confirmation would come after the faith-step, not before. Often we must obey before we see the sign.

**8. God Uses the Ordinary to Display the Extraordinary**
A common thornbush, a fugitive shepherd, ordinary desert ground—God chooses lowly vessels to display His glory. This pattern continues through Scripture to a manger, a cross, and simple bread and wine.

## Hermeneutic

### How does this passage fit within over-arching canonical threads and themes?

**1. The Divine Name Thread**
The revelation of YHWH in Exodus 3 is foundational for all subsequent Scripture:
- Genesis uses YHWH proleptically (the narrator knows the name)
- **Exodus 3: YHWH formally revealed to Moses**
- Throughout Torah: "I am YHWH" formula establishes covenant identity
- Prophets: "Thus says YHWH" establishes prophetic authority
- Jesus: "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58)—claiming YHWH identity
- Revelation: "who is and who was and who is to come" (Rev 1:8)

**2. The Theophany Thread**
Fire theophanies mark crucial moments:
- **Exodus 3: Burning bush**
- Exodus 13: Pillar of fire
- Exodus 19: Sinai ablaze with fire
- 1 Kings 18: Fire falling on Elijah's altar
- Ezekiel 1: Fire in the divine chariot vision
- Acts 2: Tongues of fire at Pentecost
- Hebrews 12:29: "Our God is a consuming fire"

**3. The Call/Commission Thread**
Exodus 3 establishes the pattern for prophetic calling:
- **Moses: Burning bush commission (Exod 3)**
- Gideon: Angel appears, commission given, sign requested (Judg 6)
- Isaiah: Throne room vision, "Whom shall I send?" (Isa 6)
- Jeremiah: "Before you were born I consecrated you" (Jer 1)
- Ezekiel: Glory vision and commissioning (Ezek 1-3)

**4. The Divine Compassion Thread**
God's response to suffering echoes throughout Scripture:
- **Exodus 3: "I have seen... heard... know... come down"**
- Judges 2:18: "The LORD was moved to pity"
- Psalm 103:13: "As a father shows compassion"
- Matthew 9:36: Jesus "had compassion on the crowds"
- Romans 8:26: The Spirit intercedes with groanings

**5. The Holy Ground Thread**
Sacred space extends from Sinai through Scripture:
- **Exodus 3: Ground holy because of presence**
- Exodus 25-40: Tabernacle—portable holy space
- 1 Kings 8: Temple—fixed holy space
- John 1:14: Word "tabernacled" among us
- 1 Corinthians 3:16: Believers as God's temple
- Revelation 21: No temple needed—God's presence fills all

**6. The Christological Thread**
The passage anticipates and connects to Christ:
- The "I AM" of Exodus 3:14 becomes Jesus' self-identification (John 8:58; 18:5-6)
- The Angel of YHWH may be pre-incarnate appearances of the Son
- Moses as deliverer typifies Christ the greater Deliverer
- The unconsumed bush: God dwelling with sinful humanity without consuming them—incarnation
- "Come down to deliver" foreshadows the incarnation

**7. The Exodus Motif**
The first Exodus establishes patterns for all subsequent redemption:
- **Exodus from Egypt under Moses**
- Return from Babylon as "second exodus" (Isaiah 40-55)
- Jesus' "exodus" at Jerusalem (Luke 9:31)
- Final exodus from this age to the age to come

### What wordplay and/or idioms are in use?

**1. seneh / Sinai**
The bush (seneh) and the mountain (Sinai) share phonetic similarity. The wordplay suggests the bush theophany gives Sinai its name—or explains why the mountain is called Sinai. This folk etymology binds the commissioning theophany to the later Sinai theophany.

**2. 'ehyeh / YHWH**
The first-person 'ehyeh ("I am/will be") and third-person YHWH ("He is/will be") are conjugations of the same root (hayah). God's self-identification and His revealed name are grammatically linked—"I AM" when speaking of Himself becomes "HE IS" when spoken of by others.

**3. "Moses, Moses"**
The doubled name is an idiom of urgent, intimate address. Compare "Abraham, Abraham" (Gen 22:11), "Samuel, Samuel" (1 Sam 3:10), "Saul, Saul" (Acts 9:4). The repetition signals momentous communication and personal relationship.

**4. Hineni ("Here I am")**
This response idiom signifies more than location—it expresses readiness, availability, and submission. Moses presents himself entirely at God's disposal.

**5. "Flowing with milk and honey"**
This idiom for the promised land combines pastoral (milk) and agricultural (honey) abundance. It represents complete fertility and blessing—the land provides abundantly for both shepherds and farmers.

**6. "Come down" (yarad)**
This idiom of divine action appears when God intervenes decisively in human affairs (cf. Gen 11:5, 7; 18:21). It expresses condescension—the transcendent God stooping to engage with human situations.

**7. "Stiff-necked people"**
Though not in this immediate passage, it becomes an idiom describing Israel's stubborn resistance (Exod 32:9; 33:3, 5; 34:9). The metaphor comes from oxen that resist the yoke.

### What are some notable micro and macro-structures in the passage?

**Micro-structures**:

**The Theophany Sequence (vv.2-6)**:
1. Visual phenomenon: the burning bush
2. Moses' attention drawn
3. God calls by name (twice)
4. Moses responds: "Here I am"
5. Command: remove sandals
6. Reason: holy ground
7. Divine self-identification
8. Moses' fear response

**The Compassion Triad (vv.7-9)**:
```
"I have surely SEEN the affliction of my people"
"I have HEARD their cry"
"I KNOW their sufferings"
```
Three verbs of divine perception leading to divine action.

**The Commission Structure (vv.10-12)**:
- Commission: "I will send you to Pharaoh"
- Objection: "Who am I?"
- Reassurance: "I will be with you"
- Sign: "You shall worship on this mountain"

**Macro-structures**:

**The Call Narrative Pattern** (Exodus 3-4 as a unit):
1. Divine confrontation (3:1-6)
2. Introductory word (3:7-9)
3. Commission (3:10)
4. Objection (3:11)
5. Reassurance (3:12)
6. Sign (3:12b)
[Pattern repeats with variations through chapter 4]

**Exodus 1-4 as Prologue Structure**:
- A. Israel in Egypt—oppression (ch. 1)
- B. Moses' early life—preparation (ch. 2)
- C. Moses' call—commission (ch. 3-4)
- → Leading to D. Confrontation with Pharaoh (chs. 5-12)

**Connection to Sinai (Exodus 19-24)**:
The burning bush theophany (ch. 3) anticipates and connects to the Sinai theophany (ch. 19). Both occur at "the mountain of God," both involve fire, both involve Moses as mediator, both reveal the divine name and character.

### What are the human image-bearer elements of the passage? Wisdom elements?

**Image-Bearer Elements**:

**1. Capacity for Divine Encounter**
Moses can see the burning bush, hear God's voice, understand divine speech, and respond. Humans alone among earthly creatures are addressed by God and can answer. This dialogical capacity reflects the image of God.

**2. Moral Responsibility**
Moses is commissioned—given a task and held accountable. Image-bearers are not passive objects but responsible agents whom God trusts with significant work.

**3. Rational Reflection**
Moses reasons: "I will turn aside to see this great sight." He asks questions, raises objections, seeks understanding. The human mind engaging divine revelation reflects the rational image of God.

**4. Emotional Response**
Moses fears—an appropriate response to holiness. Image-bearers have emotional lives that register the weight of divine encounter. Fear of the LORD is wisdom's beginning.

**5. Relational Identity**
God identifies Himself through relationship: "God of your father, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." Human identity is relational, not isolated. Moses is son, husband, son-in-law—and now prophet.

**6. Vocational Calling**
Moses receives vocation—purposeful work in God's plan. Image-bearers are not merely to exist but to serve purposes beyond themselves, participating in God's redemptive work.

**Wisdom Elements**:

**1. Fear of the LORD**
"Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look at God" (v.6). This fear is wisdom's foundation (Prov 9:10). Appropriate awe before holiness marks the wise.

**2. Attentiveness to Wonder**
Moses notices the anomaly—a bush burning without being consumed. Wisdom pays attention; fools pass by without seeing. The sage observes creation and discerns meaning.

**3. Self-Knowledge**
"Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh?" Moses knows his limitations. Wisdom includes honest self-assessment—not false humility but accurate understanding of one's capacities.

**4. Dependence on God**
The resolution to Moses' inadequacy is not self-improvement but divine presence: "I will be with you." Wisdom recognizes that human sufficiency is insufficient; God's presence is essential.

**5. Delayed Verification**
The sign would come after obedience (v.12). Wisdom can act on divine word before seeing confirmation. The wise trust God's promises and act accordingly.

### What is the plenary authorship intent in composing this text?

The divine Author (through Moses the human author) intends multiple purposes that unfold across the canon:

**1. To Reveal the Divine Name and Character**
At the most fundamental level, God authored this text to make Himself known. The name YHWH, the "I AM WHO I AM," the God who sees, hears, knows, and comes down—this self-revelation defines Israel's God and distinguishes Him from all other claimed deities. YHWH is not an unknown God but One who reveals His name and invites relationship.

**2. To Establish the Pattern of Divine Call**
God authored this passage to establish how He calls human agents. The pattern—divine initiative, human inadequacy, divine reassurance, sign given—becomes normative. Subsequent prophets and apostles experience variations of this pattern. The Church recognizes God's voice partly by this paradigm.

**3. To Ground the Exodus in Divine Compassion**
The Exodus could be told merely as liberation narrative, but God reveals His motivation: He has seen suffering, heard crying, known pain. God authored this text so that all subsequent readers would know that YHWH acts from compassion, not mere power. Redemption flows from divine love.

**4. To Prepare for Incarnation**
The burning bush—God's presence in created matter without consuming it—anticipates the ultimate union of divine and creaturely in Christ. God can dwell with flesh without destroying it. The pre-incarnate theophanies prepare Israel for the incarnation when "the Word became flesh and dwelt among us" (John 1:14). The bush is proto-incarnational.

**5. To Connect the "I AM" to Christ**
When Jesus said "Before Abraham was, I AM" (John 8:58), His hearers recognized the burning bush allusion and took up stones. God authored Exodus 3 so that this later claim would carry its full weight. Jesus claims to be YHWH, the God who spoke from the bush.

**6. To Teach That Holiness Is Presence**
God authored this text to establish that holiness is not about special places but divine presence. This prepares for the mobile tabernacle, the temple, and ultimately the indwelling of believers by the Spirit. "Do you not know that you are God's temple?" (1 Cor 3:16). The burning bush principle extends to human hearts.

**7. To Assure the Suffering That God Sees**
For every suffering community in every age, God authored this text to declare: "I have seen... heard... know." The God of the Exodus is the God who notices oppression, hears cries, and acts to deliver. This passage has sustained persecuted believers through millennia.

**8. To Model Divine-Human Partnership**
God could have delivered Israel without Moses, yet He chose to work through human agency. This text establishes the pattern of partnership—divine initiative and power working through human obedience and action. God authors history, but He writes humans into the story.

## Application

### Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience

Exodus 3:1-12 recounts the moment when God interrupted Moses' ordinary life with an extraordinary call. For forty years, Moses had been a shepherd in Midian, far from Egypt where he had once been a prince and was now a wanted man. One day, while tending his father-in-law's flocks near Mount Horeb, Moses saw something strange: a thornbush was on fire but wasn't burning up.

When Moses turned to investigate, God called him by name—twice—and told him to remove his sandals because he stood on holy ground. God then identified Himself as the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the same God who had made covenant promises to Moses' ancestors centuries earlier. Moses hid his face, afraid to look at God.

God declared that He had seen His people's suffering in Egypt, heard their cries, and known their pain. Now He had come down to deliver them and bring them to a good land. The surprise: God was sending Moses—the shepherd-fugitive—to Pharaoh to lead Israel out of Egypt.

Moses objected: "Who am I to do this?" God's answer was not a list of Moses' qualifications but a promise of presence: "I will be with you." The sign that God had truly sent him would be this: after leading Israel out, they would worship God on this very mountain.

**For modern readers, this passage reveals:**

**God notices and cares about suffering.** The triple declaration—seen, heard, known—assures us that no suffering escapes God's attention. He is not distant or indifferent. Our pain matters to Him.

**God calls unlikely people.** Moses was a failed prince, a fugitive, and an 80-year-old shepherd. Yet God chose him for history's most significant leadership role. God's calling does not depend on our resume.

**God's presence is the answer to inadequacy.** When Moses asked "Who am I?", God didn't answer with Moses' qualifications. He answered with Himself: "I will be with you." Our sufficiency is not in ourselves but in His presence.

**Ordinary places become holy when God shows up.** The ground was just desert dirt until God's presence made it sacred. God can make any place—any life—holy by His presence.

**God reveals Himself progressively.** From "God of your fathers" to "I AM WHO I AM," God unfolds His identity in stages. We come to know God increasingly as we walk with Him.

### What attributes or actions, of the modern audience, must change according to this Word?

**1. From Inattention to Attentiveness**
Moses turned aside to see. We rush past burning bushes daily—moments when God might speak if we paused to notice. We must cultivate attentiveness to God's activity in ordinary life. This means slowing down, looking for God's presence, and creating space for wonder.

**2. From Self-Sufficiency to God-Dependence**
Modern culture celebrates self-made success. Moses' question "Who am I?" and God's answer "I will be with you" redirect our confidence from ourselves to God. We must stop calculating whether we have enough resources and start trusting God's presence as sufficient.

**3. From Casual Approach to Reverent Encounter**
We often approach God casually—quick prayers, distracted worship, flippant speech about holy things. The command to remove sandals calls us to recover reverence. We must approach God as holy—not distant, but awesome.

**4. From Deaf Ears to Active Listening**
Moses answered "Here I am"—fully present, available, ready to hear. We must move from half-listening to full attention, presenting ourselves completely before God to receive what He speaks.

**5. From Passive Observation to Active Obedience**
Moses' call required him to act—to return to Egypt, to confront Pharaoh, to lead Israel. Faith that doesn't result in obedient action is incomplete. We must move from agreeing with God's words to doing what He commands.

**6. From Despair About Suffering to Trust in God's Seeing**
When suffering seems endless or unnoticed, this passage calls us to trust that God sees, hears, and knows. We must not let circumstances dictate our theology. God's awareness doesn't depend on our perception of His awareness.

**7. From Excuse-Making to Trust-Stepping**
Moses offered objections; God offered promises. We must stop rehearsing our inadequacies and start trusting God's sufficiency. Excuse-making delays obedience; trust enables it.

### When, where and how might we implement these changes?

**In Daily Life: Practice Attentiveness**
- Begin each day asking: "Lord, open my eyes to see You today."
- When something unusual or unexpected occurs, pause to consider: "Is God speaking through this?"
- Keep a journal of "burning bush moments"—times when ordinary life seemed touched by the sacred.
- Practice the discipline of silence and solitude, creating space to notice God.

**In Prayer: Cultivate Reverence and Listening**
- Before rushing into requests, pause to acknowledge God's holiness.
- Practice praying "Here I am" (hineni)—presenting yourself fully available.
- Build times of listening prayer into your routine—not speaking, just attending.
- When appropriate, adopt postures of reverence (kneeling, bowing) to engage your body in worship.

**In Suffering: Trust God's Awareness**
- When facing hardship, meditate on Exodus 3:7-9: God sees, hears, knows.
- Pray the lament psalms that bring suffering to God while trusting His compassion.
- Share burdens with trusted believers who can remind you of God's faithful character.
- Resist the lie that God is absent or indifferent; hold fast to His revealed nature.

**In Calling/Vocation: Embrace Divine Commissioning**
- When sensing God's call, resist the "Who am I?" objection that focuses on inadequacy.
- Instead, ask: "Will You be with me?" and trust His "I will."
- Take faith-steps before you have full certainty—Moses received the sign after obeying.
- Find mentors who have walked similar paths and can encourage your obedience.

**In Ordinary Places: Practice Presence**
- Recognize that your workplace, home, commute can be "holy ground" when God is present.
- Brother Lawrence's "practicing the presence of God" applies the burning bush principle—awareness of God in every moment.
- Sanctify ordinary spaces with prayer, Scripture, and intentional awareness.

**In Community: Share the Revelation**
- Tell others about the God who sees, hears, and knows their suffering.
- Bring the comfort of divine presence to those who feel alone.
- Pray with others using the names of God—"God of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, who is the I AM."

### Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?

The **meaning** is clear: God reveals Himself to those who attend, calls the inadequate with the promise of His presence, and commissions us to participate in His redemptive work. We are to approach Him with reverence, trust His seeing of our circumstances, and obey despite felt inadequacy.

The **methods** vary by personality, circumstance, and season:

**For the Distracted / Busy:**
You struggle to slow down and notice. Methods:
- Schedule "burning bush appointments"—15-minute blocks to simply be attentive to God.
- Use transitions (commuting, waiting) as attention moments rather than phone time.
- Ask a friend to hold you accountable for Sabbath rest that creates noticing space.
- Begin with just one minute of silence before prayer—build from there.

**For the Self-Reliant:**
You default to solving problems yourself. Methods:
- Before tackling any significant challenge, pray: "Lord, I cannot do this without You."
- When you succeed, immediately give thanks to God rather than congratulating yourself.
- Intentionally take on tasks beyond your ability that require God's help.
- Study passages about human weakness and divine strength (2 Cor 12:9-10).

**For the Casual Believer:**
You treat God as buddy rather than holy Lord. Methods:
- Study the "fear of the LORD" in Scripture—it is not terror but reverent awe.
- Visit a liturgical church service to experience reverent worship forms.
- Read A.W. Tozer's *The Knowledge of the Holy* to recover God's transcendence.
- Practice physical reverence—kneel, bow, remove metaphorical "sandals" of casualness.

**For the Sufferer:**
You wonder if God sees your pain. Methods:
- Write out Exodus 3:7-9 and post it where you'll see it daily.
- Pray Scripture back to God: "You said You see, hear, know—hold me to Your word."
- Find community that will witness your suffering and pray with you.
- Read testimonies of others who trusted God in suffering and experienced His faithfulness.

**For the Fearful / Reluctant:**
You sense God's call but feel wholly inadequate. Methods:
- Make a list of biblical characters who felt inadequate: Moses, Gideon, Isaiah, Jeremiah. Note how God responded.
- Shift focus from your abilities to God's presence—memorize "I will be with you."
- Take the smallest obedient step today. You don't need to see the whole path.
- Find a mentor who can walk alongside you as you step into calling.

**For the Skeptic:**
You doubt God really communicates today. Methods:
- Study how God has spoken throughout Scripture and history—patterns recur.
- Ask God to show you a "burning bush"—an unmistakable sign of His presence.
- Engage with testimonies of believers who have experienced God's call.
- Be honest with God about your doubts; He welcomed Moses' questions.
