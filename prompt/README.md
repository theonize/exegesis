# AI Guided Study

An AI model is an excellent research assistant.
However, we cannot trust that these models will give us "finished" material.
Treat the AI like you would a calculator: always verify.

e.g. if a calculator gives 2+2=943 it's obviously wrong-
because you know how addition works-
that answer is way too big, 
and it's odd, the answer should be even.

Use it as a springboard to find answers and dig a little deeper.
Research and critique every answer it gives you: test & probe.
AI is an excellent resource but does not replace study or research.
