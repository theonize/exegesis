# AI Guided Study

An AI model is an excellent research assistant.
However, we cannot trust that these models will give us "finished" material.
Treat the AI like you would a calculator: always verify.

e.g. if a calculator gives 2+2=943 it's obviously wrong-
because you know how addition works;
at the very least that what is way too big;
and it's odd, the answer should be even.

If you don't know how to very the answer then use it as a springboard.
Test & probe, draw on other resources and use the AI to speed up and refine the results.
