Give some modern day applications of Revelation 1:1-8
* Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience
* Who?  my audience is contemporary suburban Texans ranging in age from 6th grade to twilight
* What attributes or actions, of theirs, must change according to this Word?
* When would we do these things?
* Where might we do these things?
* How would the current audience implement these changes?
* Distinguish meaning and method?
