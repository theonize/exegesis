# Shepherd Skill

Research and determine the context of a Biblical passage by answering the following questions:
* Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience
* What attributes or actions, of the modern audience, must change according to this Word?
* When, where and how might we implement these changes?
* Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?
