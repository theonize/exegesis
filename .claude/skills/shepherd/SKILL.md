# Shepherd Skill

Research and determine the context of a Biblical passage by answering the following questions:
* Clarify the original meaning for a modern audience
* What attributes or actions, of the modern audience, must change according to this Word?
* When, where and how might we implement these changes?
* Meaning versus method: how might I accomplish these things?

## Output Format

Produce content under the heading `## Application`.

Organize answers as `### ` subsections:

### 1. Clarifying the Original Meaning for a Modern Audience
Bridge the ancient context to contemporary life. Use comparison tables:
| Ancient Reality | Modern Equivalent |

### 2. What Must Change
Attributes, attitudes, and actions the passage calls the modern audience to alter. Include diagnostic questions for self-examination.

### 3. When, Where, and How to Implement
Context-specific guidance. Use implementation tables:
| Context | When | Where | How |

### 4. Meaning Versus Method
The fixed theological principle versus flexible application methods. Distinguish what is timeless from what is culturally situated.
